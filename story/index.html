                Son of the late satyr demigod Papposilenus and a druid upholding his father's ideals, Barases searches for his brother Petraynus - heir to his father's godhead.
                His father's domain has grown increasingly strained and twisted after his passing, rot settling into the heart of the wood. Dutiful and loyal, Barases has ventured 
                far from the comfort of the Feywild in search of the prodigal son in hopes of restoring balance.

                the evil forces working against Elsir Vale. While infiltrating the Wicked Fang tribe she was captured and subjected to
                Fangren's corrupt rituals manipulating enemies from the Elemental Chaos. Rescued before being sacrificed, Bin now continues 
                her mission alongside the Dusk Wardens, imbued with the power of the elements by Fangren's rituals.

                In service to Sarshan he objected too loudly to his employer's unethical practices and was imprisoned for it. Rescued by the

                all the confining restrictions of her childhood when she came of age: her mother's expectations, the conservativeness and 
                propriety of her Dragonborn culture - even her gender (she is physically male). Blessed (or cursed) with her father's wanderlust 
                she left home to train as a bard where her flamboyant rebellion, cross-dressing fashion sense, and acerbic wit found an 
                appreciative audience. She has a talent for appealing to the rebels in restrictive cultures and has plied it with success among 
                the dwarves of Elsir Vale. She searches for a way to truly break free of her bonds and fully realize her feminine self.

                Second child of Thrand U'Squiel (ranger of the Stagrunner elves) and a tiefling warlock, Kallista found little acceptance among her father's family as a tielfing. That and 
                the general aloofness of the elves made her father distant, and in reaction to that pain she rejected the calming influence of her father's nature and 
                gave into the evil pull of her infernal heritage - resorting to alcohol, drugs, and eventually crime. Her vices have spiraled on multiple occasions, 
                encouraged by her friend Festivus' flamboyance and tempered by her sister Karrion's redemptive nature.

                She became a ranger who guards the sanctity of nature, a vegetarian and champion of animals. As a protector of the weak and the voiceless, 
                Karrion constantly struggles against her infernal heritage, channeling that power to do good. Redeeming her evil nature has led her to use that 
                energy to redeem others, most often her rebellious sister Kallista.

                Kitara was stolen from her Shadar-kai parents - members of the Winter Court - as a child by the forces of the Fomorian lord Cachlain (The Stone-Skinned King). 
                Drafted into the Fomori legion, she was raised to be an elite warrior and an arcane assassin. At puberty she was taken by the coven of Howling Hags in service 
                to Cachlain and multilated in perverse Fomori rituals - they took her eye and part of her soul but grafted a new eye and part of new soul in its place. The 
                ritual twisted her, but also granted her greater powers. Feeling betrayed by this violation Kitara fled Cachlain's service and ended up working as a mercenary 
                under Sarshan before leaving his service as well in disgust. Now she acts against her former masters in a mission of revenge.

                Child of the prestigious Stagrunner clan of the elves of Endless Plains, Lechonero was trained in the ways of the wild by Thrand U'Squiel to 
                help guard the borders against the orc hordes to the south. When Thrand travelled to Elsir Vale as a member of the Dawn Wardens Lechonero made 
                frequent visits to his mentor. Taking advantage of his frequent trips along the Dawn Way, Lechonero's clan elder Caliandra used him as a trading 
                envoy to the eastern city of Dornaithos, the first trading post of Astrazalian fully in the world. When Thrand returned to the Stagrunners he  
                charged Lechonero with looking after his daughters Kallista and Karrion. Recently in Dornaithos, Lechonero had an affair with 
                Brandowen ("Brandi") Entromiel - the master of that mercantile settlement and as aggressive a lover as she was a saleswoman. In a heated moment 
                that ended their affair Lechonero inadvertently absconded with her bonded bear companion from the Feywild and he has been avoiding her ever since.

                Maglubiyet to Tiamat. He united the goblinoid tribes of the Wyrmsmoke Mountains and dubbed them the Kulkor Zhul and adopted the 
                standard of the Red Hand (an ancient symbol of Tiamat's cult). Conquering the Wyrmsmoke Mountains he named his kingdom Harg 
                Kulkor - "Land of the Dragon." Crowning himself High Wyrmlord he marched his army to conquer an unsuspecting Elsir Vale. The 
                adventuring party the Dawn Wardens encountered the army early by happenstance and stymied its advance by collapsing the ancient 
                dwarven bridge at Skull Gorge. In the interim they rallied the people of the vale to defend against the Red Hand and ultimately 
                assassinated Azarr Kul. Without his leadership his fractuous army split and turned on itself, leading to its defeat by the 
                peoples of the Vale.

                Two-Teeth, named after the teeth he lost after being

                traveling through Brindol at the time of the race.
                Spying an opportunity for profit and being accustomed
                to long-distance running since childhood, he
                saw it as a chance for some easy money to pay his
                way across the land.
                Two-Teeth is a stereotypical brute. If he thinks he
                can get away with it, he would have no compunction about
                tackling, beating, knocking out, or otherwise interfering
                with another runner in order to get ahead.

                Sinruth was a hobgoblin with greater aspirations than
                a life spent preying on the fringes of civilization. He
                listened closely at the campfires when his fathers
                and uncles told tales of the Red Hand of Doom, a
                mighty army that ran across the land like a scythe.
                And when he became an adult and a leader of his
                own band of hobgoblins, he found a cache of tunics
                and weapons left behind by that army. Sinruth felt
                his destiny calling. He declared himself the new
                Warlord of Sinruth's Hand (as he named the group),
                emblazoned every possible surface with a crudely
                painted, downward thrusting red hand insignia, and
                set about recruiting the massive army that he felt was
                his birthright.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                But starting an army wasn't as easy as those campfire
                tales led Sinruth to believe. Years passed with
                Sinruth's band eking out a meager existence in the
                wilderness. But slowly, he started to gain allies. A
                temporary bargain with some sinister, mischievous
                gnomes blossomed into a lasting friendship. The Red
                Hand's exploration of the mountains unearthed some
                undisturbed catacombs beneath the long-ruined
                Castle Rivenroar. Sinruth struck another bargain,
                and the undead guardians let the Red Hand move
                in, in exchange for periodic payment of kidnapped
                prisoners.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Sinruth and the reconstituted Red Hand had a
                base and a growing reputation, but they were far from
                a mighty army. An "Emissary" from another remnant of
                the Red Hand offered to join forces under Sinruth's
                banner and more than double Sinruth's fifty soldiers
                under arms. All Sinruth had to do was attack Brindol,
                steal some relics from the original Red Hand invasion,
                and take enough prisoners to keep the undead
                guardians of Rivenroar satisfied.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Sinruth personally led the assault on Brindol, sacking 
                Brindol's Hall of Great Valor, stealing back
                many of the museum pieces on display there. Sinruth
                brought back seven prisoners, despite the fact that the
                new Red Hand lost half its number in the attack. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Sinruth died at the hands of the Dusk Wardens when they 
                came to rescue the prisoners and retrieve the relics.

            <span class="description">
                Tusk was an orc leader is an overlarge warrior and chieftain. Not a true orc, he has the blood of
                ogres in his veins, which made him larger, tougher,
                and eminently more dangerous. Having slaughtered
                half a dozen orc chieftains, he drew together the
                unruly tribes to mount an offensive against Bordrin's
                Watch to lay claim to the soft lands beyond its walls.
                Tusk knew the history of the Stonehome Mountains
                well, knowing that unless he could find some way to
                bypass the fortress in the mountains, it wouldn't matter
                how many warriors he commanded since he would fail.
                What Tusk needed was a way around the fortress.
                Ever resourceful and with numerous contacts and
                allies, Tusk turned to his occasional lover and advisor,
                a shadar-kai witch named Myrissa. He sent her back
                to the Shadowfell to recruit allies to help his cause,
                and a short time later she returned with a small army
                of dark ones, led by a mysterious and sinister dark
                creeper, known as the Emissary (Modra). This leader offered
                to assist Tusk in exchange for an exclusive arrangement
                in which they would supply Tusk's armies with
                weaponry for whatever price Modra asked, and in exchange, the dark creepers
                would find a way through the mountains. Tusk readily
                agreed and paid the exorbitant price, gaining a
                fine arsenal, and also, he hoped, the key to victory.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Not long after, the dark creepers returned and
                revealed a number of tunnels burrowed beneath the
                mountain. They showed the chieftain the locations of
                each, explaining how the passages connected one side
                of the mountains to the other. No tunnel was large
                enough to accommodate his entire army, so, Tusk
                gave his horde their marching orders, sending them
                to climb the mountain slopes, while his scouts moved
                ahead to secure the tunnels and prepare the way for
                Tusk and his elite warriors to strike the fortress from
                below.

                out on his cheeks and two umbral panthers as pets. At first he captured the

                Amyria is a mysterious deva dedicated to Bahamut that sprang from a ceremonial platinum 
                longsword kept in Brindol's Hall of Great Valor. The longsword was stolen by Sinruth and 
                recovered by our heroes. Richard D'Eversholt, a paladin of Bahamut, left the party after 
                recovering the sword and became castellan of the Hall of Great Valor. One day the sword 
                spoke, summoning the heroes and asking them to stop the gnoll Fangren's dark ritual 
                manipulating planar energies and put them to a different purpose: releasing Amyria from the 
                sword. Once back in her own body Amyria had no memory and brought our heroes back to 
                Overlook where she prayed for guidance before disappearing during the githyanki siege.
                Now our heroes have rediscovered her in Sayre, trying to form a coalition of neighboring 
                groups and kindgoms to fight the githyanki invasion.

                Fangren was a demonic gnoll and chief of the Wicked Fang tribe who plagued the lands around 
                the Giantshield Mountains. Receiving aid (in the form of weapons and advisors) from Sarshan, 
                Fangren took up residence in the abandoned monastery, Fortress Graystone.
                He attempted to use the planar energies of the Elemental Chaos woven into the place by its 
                githzerai creators to perform a ritual that would turn him into an exarc of the demon lord 
                Yeenoghu. Our heroes killed Fangren's followers and shadar-kai allies before halting the 
                Fangren's ritual sacrifice of Bin and instead channeled the ritual's energies into a ritual 
                of their own that released Amyria from her sword. Melvin mysteriously disappeared while exploring 
                Fortress Graystone, only to reappear months later fighting the githyanki. Among Sarshan's gifts 
                to Fangren was the magical blade called Wicked Fang in honor of his tribe.

                monitoring them when they fought other enemies. He waited until they were sufficiently

                against other enemies if it looked like someone else might successfully collect the bounty. 
                In the end he ambushed them in the aftermath of their confrontation with Fangren but they

                    Once, he reigned supreme.
                </p>
                <p>
                    General Zithiruun was a great hero - one of the
                    most respected military leaders of a militant race.
                    From the great city of Tu'narath, he led armies of the
                    githyanki on raids across the Astral Sea, and into a
                    dozen different regions and kingdoms of the mortal
                    realm. From the deck of the astral galleon Siun'kara
                    or the back of Rathoraiax, his great red dragon steed,
                    Zithiruun proved an unstoppable force - a champion
                    among a race of champions. Even Vlaakith, the
                    fearsome githyanki lich queen, acknowledged his
                    greatness, heaped great praise upon him.
                    And then the great General Zithiruun took on a
                    foe beyond even his own prowess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That it was a dragon, a dragon far greater than
                    Rathoraiax, everyone knows, but tales of the confrontation
                    differ as to whether it was a black wyrm,
                    one of the fearsome scourge dragons, or something
                    else entirely. But while not everyone knows precisely
                    what it was Zithiruun faced, everyone knows what
                    happened as a result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A hideous burst of something - acid, perhaps, or
                    pure necrotic energy - ripped the life from the red
                    dragon Rathoraiax, shredding flesh and obliterating
                    entire portions of the beast. And it was this attack
                    that felled Zithiruun as well. It stripped the strength
                    from his limbs, rotted bits of flesh and even weakened
                    bone. Any lesser warrior would have died in that hideous
                    moment, but the general clung to life through
                    sheer force of stubborn, malignant will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It took years for Zithiruun to retrain and reinvigorate
                    his broken body. Even by the time he encountered our heroes, he was a shadow of
                    what he once was - weaker in body, far less sound in
                    mind. His own people had all but turned their backs
                    on him; though his great achievements prevented them
                    from executing or exiling him utterly, they scorn his
                    weakness and hold him in contempt for allowing himself
                    and his mount to be so soundly defeated. By the siege of Overlook,
                    Zithiruun served as a lowly operative of Tu'narath's
                    forces and he led only lesser warriors into battle
                    while answering to and obeying githyanki who would
                    once have feared even to speak in his presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zithiruun's native powers had mutated through
                    his years of effort as he attempted to reinvigorate
                    his body at the expense of his mental prowess. The
                    ambition all githyanki share had been subsumed by
                    a burning need to prove himself and to regain the
                    position and the respect that were once his by right - 
                    even as he nursed a resentful hatred of the very people
                    whose adulation he so desperately craved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zithiruun had been large for a githyanki, but since the
                    destruction and atrophy of much of his musculature,
                    he appeared almost impossibly tall and gaunt.
                    Mixed with and attached to the traditional leathers of
                    his people, he wore a contraption of braces and harnesses,
                    constructed of leather straps and iron joints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These braces, supported at his shoulders and by a strap
                    across his chest, ran the length of his left arm and left
                    leg, as well as a portion of his right leg. It is the straps
                    that gave those limbs rigidity; without them, they could
                    scarcely move, and not support his weight. This harness
                    also granted him full mobility; charged with both
                    magic and psychic energy, it permited him motion and
                    granted him strength he would otherwise lack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His flesh clung tightly to his skeleton and puckered
                    away from old wounds, exposing muscle and even
                    charred bone. His left cheek gaped open, revealing
                    a bit of metal plate that replaced a fragment of skull.
                    A leather strap held the left side of his jaw in place,
                    replacing obliterated muscle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He appeared weak indeed, and in some ways he
                    truly was. Yet Zithiruun wielded his great silver saber
                    with an astonishing, impossible precision, and his
                    eyes burned with loathing and ambition to shame even
                    the other githyanki.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite his drive, General Zithiruun met his end at the 
                    hands of our heroes when he laid siege to Overlook with 
                    his mercenary army.

                    The Tiri Kitor have a presence here, but don't protect it nearly as well as the Marth Forest. Most of this woodland is still wild, and home to all manner of beasts. Roads and humanoid trails generally 
                    skirt the edges of the forest. Rumors suggest that creatures from the Blackfens Swamp have begun to wander into the Witchwood.

                <p>
                    The only other city of any significance in the region, Dennovar lies 100 miles east of Brindol on the Dawn Way. It too has an outer defensive wall of stone. Population 11,000. 
                    Dennovar has its share of farm land, but it also sits on a huge lake, Lake Ern. Seafood and water related products are common trade goods from Dennovar. Dennovar hasn't been attacked by anything 
                    significant in hundreds of years. In fact, several of the gates are in poor working order, despite the lessons learned by most of the Vale forty years ago. A merchant council is the governing body.

                    Once a prosperous city and center of the kingdom of Rhestilor, Rhest is now a half-drowned ruin slowly sinking into the Blackfens Swamp. At its peak, the surrounding lands were well tended fields with 
                    levies, irrigation systems, and were clear for miles. Centuries of erosion and lack of attention have turned the farmlands into swamp. Rice and soybean fields are now overgrown with twisted trees, 
                    poisonous vines, and are crawling with snakes, crocodiles, and worse. Civilized people abandoned the place long ago. The only intelligent beings there now are lizard folk, if you consider them 
                    intelligent.

                    Jarmaan Keep predates the nation of Rhestilor. It was built on the remains of an ancient dwarven keep over 500 hundred years ago. During the reign of Rhestilor, the village around the keep grew into a 
                    town, then a city. When that great nation fell apart, the commanding officer, Kerden Jarmaan, claimed the keep as his own. It's been in the Jarmaan family ever since, and at 
                    least one member of the Jarmaan family has sat on the council of Brindol, typically in a leadership position, without fail...

                <h3>Overlook Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    This city of stone stands on the side of the Stonehome Mountains. Constructed as a haven for newly liberated dwarves from their former giant masters, Overlook has since outgrown its noble roots and become a haven for peoples all over the Elsir Vale and beyond. 
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h5>Population:</h5> 
                    12,250; about another 5,000 people live in small settlements scattered on the lower slopes. The people of Overlook are mostly dwarves, humans, and halflings, though pockets of dragonborn, tiefling, eladrin, and elf communities are isolated in their own ethnic neighborhoods. Overlook's importance as a trade center results in great numbers of travelers from faraway lands and of a wild assortment of races, cultures, and beliefs, lending the city its cosmopolitan atmosphere. Government: The Council of Elders, a group of five male and female dwarves, governs Overlook. Each is elected to office and serves a 10-year term. The dwarves see ruling as a burden and none relish the job, preferring to hand power off to someone else. Heading up the Council is the Great Elder, Morgoff Stonefirst, an aging dwarf who's ready to retire. 
                </div>
                <p>
                    One representative from each of the eight districts of Overlook attends the Council, serving as advisors and also to air the grievances of their particular constituencies. Although these individuals have the power to influence, they have no real authority in the city, though many are wealthy and powerful by means other than the office they hold.

                <div class="fullpage">
                    <h5>Defense:</h5> 
                    Overlook keeps a standing garrison of 150 warriors armed and ready for any threat. In times of trouble (such as now), Overlook can muster another 500 warriors from the local militia, and another 100 from the outlying settlements. At Bordrin's Watch, another 500 hundred warriors protect the mountain pass from within its steep walls and skyscraping towers.

                <p>
                    The city of Overlook stands on the eastern slopes of
                    the Stonehome Mountains, a hoary range of crumbling
                    peaks as old as the world. The city's founding
                    lies sometime far back in the mists of time, at a point
                    after the dwarves in this region threw off the shackles
                    of slavery and chased the giants and orcs west across
                    the mountains at the end of the Age of Chains. Overlook,
                    and the fastness of Bordrin's Watch, were raised
                    to safeguard the liberated dwarf peoples and to be
                    the first line of defense should their ancient enemies
                    forget their defeat and seek to enslave the dwarves
                    once more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since its founding, Overlook has never come under
                    attack, though Bordrin's Watch has time and again,
                    at least once every century. Overlook supplies the
                    mountain pass with soldiers, supplies, and needed
                    resources, ensuring the Watch is never without the
                    goods they need to live up to their ancient responsibility.
                    While doughty dwarf warriors hold the
                    Watch, the city is far more cosmopolitan and includes
                    peoples of nearly every race and culture known in
                    this corner of the world. Dwarves are still the dominate
                    group, but humans and halflings make up a
                    close second, followed by dragonborn, tieflings, and a
                    smattering of eladrin and elves, and an assortment of
                    other, less familiar, races.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overlook is largely a trading center, and people
                    on both sides of the mountain come to the city to
                    exchange goods, rumors, and information. The city's
                    numerous markets and bustling streets makes it the
                    ideal place to do business, thus characters in search
                    of a particular tool or device are more likely to find it
                    here than anywhere for miles around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Supplementing its trade is a robust mining industry.
                    The mountains are rich in iron, silver, tin, and no
                    few gemstones. Dwarf and human miners and prospectors
                    set out from Overlook each day, some working
                    in the blackness of the deep mines, while others scour
                    the heights in search of treasures-some succeeding,
                    others failing, and others still vanishing in the misty
                    peaks never to be seen again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the city depends on Bordrin's Watch to
                    endure most of the attacks from the west, the city is
                    not without its own defenses. The dwarves erected
                    steep walls to protect themselves, but as the city outgrew
                    its original protections, the inhabitants raised
                    more walls to encircle the growing population. So far,
                    this has happened four times, giving the city four sets
                    of walls, one inside of the other. The shantytown, the
                    unofficial ninth district, grows beyond the eastern
                    walls and it's just a matter of time before the Council
                    decides to raise another wall and add those squatters
                    to the rest of the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Piercing each wall, on both the western side and
                    the eastern side, is a large gate flanked by two square
                    stone towers. Most times, the gates stand open, even
                    in the dead of night, but when trouble looms, such
                    as now, the gates are closed at dusk, and the inner
                    gates-the ones leading into High Hall - might close
                    even earlier. 
                    
                    The outer walls are 100 feet tall, taller where they travel over higher elevation. 
                    Each inner wall stands another 20 feet tall. Guards patrol the walls infrequently, 
                    though the gatehouses are held by a half-dozen warriors.

                    <h3>Overlook Districts</h3>
                    <p>Overlook has eight districts, each distinguished by the types of its people there as well as the industry one finds there.</p>
                    <section id="Blister">
                        <h4>Blister</h4>
                        <blockquote>"Looking for work? You ought to prick the blister an' see what bubbles up . . ."</blockquote>
                        <p>The Blister is a rough-and-tumble section of the city, populated by mercenaries, adventurers, and the usual sort of traveling folk with few roots. Characterized by a great number of winesinks, taverns, pleasure dens, gambling halls, and bordellos, Blister is not a place to get lost.</p>
                        <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        Blister's buildings are a mix of timber and stone of architectural styles ranging the gamut. Old dwarven buildings stand next to almost organic tiefling dreaming halls, while a halfling gambling den sits in the shadow of an old temple dedicated to Sehanine in her more larcenous aspect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        Blister's roads thread their way through the press of buildings, darkened by shadows cast by structures built too close together. Filth and detritus clog the alleys, sometimes spilling out onto the major thoroughfares-that is, roads large enough to accommodate a horse.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        Humans, halflings, and dragonborn have the largest numbers in Blister, though one can find a variety of races here. As mentioned, most are adventurers, thieves, and traveling folk, representing the city's most diverse population.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <h5>Sights:</h5>
                        Visitors and inhabitants alike might see a pair of human thugs beating a half-orc with their clubs in an alley, a scantily clad man calling out to passersby, a street magician performing tricks, an elderly alchemist selling cure-alls, street preachers prophesizing the end of the world, tents and stalls, clotheslines stretched across the streets, and bands of adventurers looking for trouble.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <h5>Smells:</h5>
                        All sorts of odors waft up from Blister, including smells of exotic cuisine to the expected stench of a crowded district. Wood smoke hangs over the streets, mixing with other, more sinister smells.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <h5>Sounds:</h5>
                        Merchants hawk their wares amid laughter, screams, the murmur of crowds, the clatter of kitchens, cries of "thief!," the whistle of a constable in pursuit, the sounds of barking dogs, the hiss of cats, and the growls of spiretop drakes.

                        <p>
                            Occupying the southeast corner of Overlook, Boneyard has every distasteful business and venture, including everything from the city's slaughterhouses, renderers, tanners, dyers, and even the city's graveyards.

                        <p>

                            As an industrial corner of the city, most buildings are plain and functional, and they are constructed to serve the operation and little else. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h5>Streets:</h5> 
                            The Boneyard features broad roads in good repair so wagons can easily navigate the district. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h5>People:</h5> 
                            Humans are the largest group of people here and most are dirty, lacking in sophistication, and inured to the foul odors wafting up from the more toxic parts of the district. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h5>Sights:</h5> 
                            Common sights include wagons laden with animal carcasses, workers trudging to their jobs, plumes of acrid smoke, and pipes leaking toxic fluids into the gutters. The Boneyard is as unpleasant to look at as it is to smell. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h5>Smells:</h5> 
                            A pall of smoke stinking of urine and sulfur hangs over the Boneyard, turning the sun a pale shade of brown. Even though the locals do their best to keep the streets free of rubbish, the materials and industries produce ripe odors a shade better than death.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h5>Sounds:</h5> 
                            One can hear the creaks of wagons, the spillage of liquids, crackling fire, the screams of animals at the slaughter, and the grunts of hard labor.

                        <h4>Elftown</h4> 
                        <blockquote>"Don't know why they still call it Elftown; can't say as I've ever seen an elf there."</blockquote> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Elftown covers the northwestern corner of the inner city and takes its name from the one elf to live there some seventy years ago. The community consists of upscale and well-off entrepreneurs, merchants, bankers, lawyers, physicians, and other members of Overlook's upper crust, and many folk elsewhere want to inhabit a small house on the edge of this fine quarter. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h5>Buildings:</h5> 
                            With fine buildings of astonishing architecture, white-washed or painted in pastel colors, Elftown has some of the nicest homes and shops in the city. Even the smaller houses are sumptuous compared to those of pretty much anywhere else in the city, and all are accented by parks, lawns of green grass, statuary, and beds of exotic flowers and semimobile plants. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h5>Streets:</h5> 
                            Aside from the broad Dwarfroad that winds though Elftown, most streets are large enough to accommodate two carriages side by side. The roads are covered in pale white stone and maintained by a legion of well-paid servants. Even the side streets are clean and lit with everburning torches contained in iron lanterns to chase away the shadows.

                            In spite of the name, few, if any, elves live in Elftown, though several eladrin are affiliated with the ambassador who takes residence here. Instead, wealthy humans and dwarves command this section of the city, though one can be sure to find a handful of dragonborn, a smattering of tieflings, and a few reckless halflings.

                            The Forgeworks, or just the Forge, is a middle-class district given over to successful artisans, tradesfolk, and other men and women who work hard and are successful in their professions. More than half of the buildings here are workshops with apartments overhead. Warehouses, businesses, stables, and other places of industry round out the rest. The Forgeworks stands in the Middle City, south of Tradetown.

                            Broad streets, wide enough to accommodate aurochs and wagons, run through this district, while narrow alleys branch off to disappear in the maze of buildings beyond. Cobbles cover the ground and most are even to provide smooth transport to and from the Forge. 
                            <h5>People:</h5> 
                            Dwarves and humans live side by side in the Forgeworks, but one can also find a small population of half-elves, gnomes, and a few others as well. During the day, business here brings folk from all over the city to do business.

Although a busy part of Overlook, the Forgeworks is surprisingly clean.

                        <h4>High Hall</h4> 
                        <blockquote>"The heart and soul of Overlook, son, High Hall is where the movers and shakers make all the decisions."</blockquote> 
                        <p>
                            High Hall, or the Old City, is where the city leaders convene to govern Overlook. Few folk still live in High Hall since nearly every inch of available space is given over to the various ministries making up the city's government. Thus, aside from a few extremely wealthy folks, most people funnel out of High Hall at the end of the day to head home to Elftown, Stonehammer, or elsewhere. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h5>Buildings:</h5> 
                            High Hall consists of a forest of massive buildings packed tightly inside its walls. Towers thrust up from the fortresslike structures, climbing high above the walls and affording a look at the entire city and the lands all around. Most buildings house one of the dozen or so ministries that see to keeping the city operating. Examples include the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of War, and so on. Each operates out of a marble or brick building fronted by impressive statues of dwarf warriors, artisans, and historical figures, while the walls themselves bear intricate carvings and bas-reliefs capturing key moments from the city's history. The outer edge of High Hall holds the businesses and few homes of those who grease the engines of politics. Restaurants, inns, and a few shops provide patronage to the city's elite, but they shut down at nightfall.

                        <p>
                            <h5>Streets:</h5> 
                            Suffering from too many buildings in a confined space, High Hall's roads are positively perilous. Tight and cramped while winding through the heart of Overlook, they contain numerous shadowy alcoves, dead-ends, and limited range of sight as they turn and twist. Although High Hall doesn't have a thievery problem, it does suffer from hired killers. The dwarves deal honorably with one another, but the same cannot be said for all the city's representatives, and rival humans, tieflings, and others might resort to murder to eliminate an inflexible politician. Thus, most high-ranking officials surround themselves with guards, making travel anywhere in High Hall all the harder.

                            The Council of Elders might all be dwarves, but the rest of the city's government is as diverse as the city. Bureaucrats, functionaries, messengers, and palanquins bearing representatives from other districts all make their way through High Hall throughout the day, and sometimes at night. 
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Buildings, buildings, and more buildings crowd the district, their carved faades telling ancient stories of heroic dwarves, the end of the Age of Chains, and other historical events that helped shape this region. One might see workers cleaning up a murder scene, while street vendors sell everything from amulets that promise to bring good luck in the courts, to food dealers, and tattered street lawyers searching for clients.

                            Overcrowding and the malaise of too many people gives High Hall an unpleasant aroma in spite of the fact that the Council spares no expense in keeping this part of the city clean. Wafting up from the streets is a mix of rubbish, food, and sweat, but compared to other sections of Overlook, High Hall is tolerable.

                            Throughout the day, a steady hum of conversation sounds, punctuated with the ringing of bells, the angry shouts of guards as they escort their worthy charges through the press of people, voices raised in protest at some new law, and an assortment of other noises make High Hall loud. At night, however, it becomes deathly quiet.

                        <p>
                            Nine Bells district takes its name for the nine temples found in the heart of the district. Since these temples cater to the sick and the poor, this district draws the hungry, the diseased, and the destitute to its streets. Before the walls were raised here, Nine Bells was a place of great wealth-a community favored by those rich citizens who wanted to escape the clamor of the city. However, after it was annexed along with Blister and the Boneyard, the estates were abandoned and the folks fled to Stonehammer or Elftown to escape the flood of destitute people that washed into the place. Now, Nine Bells is the worst part of the city and is ever a source of embarrassment for the city's elite.

                            With rotting estates, old vineyards now overrun by tents and wooden shacks, sagging rowhouses, and communities of tents, Nine Bells decays even while the rest of the city grows strong. The businesses, such as they are,
                            cater to darker interests, including dreaming halls, sinister taverns, fighting pits, and disease-ridden brothels. Huddled in one corner of this district are nine great temples, raised long ago, but faced, on all sides, by poverty, despair, and the worst sorts of people imaginable. Called the Divine Knot, a few of these temples have been abandoned, while the rest keep small staffs of dedicated servants who soldier on to fight the misery plaguing this district.

                            As one might expect, Nine Bells' streets are muddy lanes and narrow alleys, all filthy and most worming through the press of decaying buildings. Closest to the temples, the muddy roads gain cobbles, typically clean and free of debris.

                            Nine Bells is the bottom of the barrel, so to speak, and it welcomes anyone who has nowhere else to go. Humans, dwarves, tieflings, halflings, gnomes, and even a few half-orcs scratch out an existence in this wretched mire. Despair is strong here and it drives many
                            of its people to commit unspeakable acts to survive. Drugs, prostitution, and even slavery can all be found here.

                            A fecal stench hangs in the air, mixed with the equally nauseating odors of vomit, rot, and rubbish. People here are unclean and their odors mingle with that of the befouled air to create a symphony of noxious odors. Nearest to the temples, the air grows a bit more tolerable thanks to incense and the modicum of respect the people show the men and women of the cloth.

                            carcass, the splash of effluvia, and the whisper of a threat.

                            Stonehammer occupies the southern half of the inner city, and it wraps around High Hall up to the Dwarfroad. Like Elftown, Stonehammer is home to the wealthy citizens of Overlook, specifically the dwarves. Since this district is cleaner, safer, and more exclusive than other parts of the city, great deal of resentment exists toward the folks of Stonehammer from those of lower means and status.

                            Stonehammer is the most dwarven of districts, and its buildings are grand, sweeping, and magnificent to behold. Towers that thrust up from lower levels rival those found in High Hall in terms of height and grandeur. Since space is at a premium, the dwarves here have built upward. The wealthiest citizens live in the aeries, while servants, low-born dwarves, and all those who support the sumptuous lifestyles of the
                            elite dwell in the 'Dark-the bowels of Stonehammer.

                            Stonehammer is exclusively a dwarven district and nondwarves are not permitted to live here. Other races often work in the 'Dark, but even they must keep their residences outside the district. Folk here are wealthy and powerful, and they represent the best the city has to offer.

                            Tradetown is a melting pot of all races, cultures, and occupations. In many ways, Tradetown is a lot like the Blister, but it has been established for longer and it has a mix of fabulous wealth and appalling poverty. Tradetown, as one might expect, is a commercial and retail district, where merchants, tradesfolk, and prospectors come to do business. Most middle-tier business-inclined people have homes here and gather in coffee
                            houses, upscale bars, and bathhouses to do business. In stark contrast to the bustling commerce, Tradetown is also home to a powerful thieving guild named the Lost Ones. A clandestine organization, they have agreements with nearly all the major enterprises here, offering protection (or rather exemption) from thievery and the promise to leave their customers alone.

                            Tradetown is a hodgepodge of stone buildings (many of dwarven architecture), wooden structures, warehouses, shops, inns, taverns, and everything and anything a person might want in a city of this size.

                            Tradetown is every bit as cramped as the Blister and in some ways more so for the vendors and hawkers crowding the streets. Moving merchandise into Tradetown is a chore and often requires porters rather than wagons to transport anything of size. The roads are cobbled, but alleys and side-streets might be muddy and covered in rubbish.

Shady men and women walk the streets, eyes in constant motion as they search for new marks, while grifters and charlatans peddle cure-alls or use trickery to part their customers from their coin. Urchins run through the alleys, leading visitors through the safer parts of Tradetown, while disguised halflings lead other visitors to the nastier corners, where the travelers can find beatings and robberies instead of their destinations.

                            An unsettling mixture of roasting meats, beer, ale, and spices blends with excrement, sweat, and the strange odors of illegal substances,
                            wreathing the district in a perpetual haze.

                            One can hear woman's laughter, a dragonborn's growl, an argument, a shout of "thief!," children playing, a yelping dog, a persistent merchant's pitch, and the whispered invitations from second-story rooms overlooking the narrow streets.

                        <p>
                            Not a true district, Shantytown clings to the back of the city like festering boil. Shantytown is a wretched maze of tents, shacks, and rotting wooden buildings, and it is home to the poorest and most desperate of people that have nowhere else to go. Most of Shantytown's people are refugees from other lands, victims of tragedy and circumstance, or exiles who keep a low profile so they can go about their wicked business without attracting attention. Thus, Shantytown's people are beggars, destitute farmers, maimed adventurers, undead, necromancers, cultists, and worse, all thrown together in one of the most
                            desperate spots in the region.

                        <p>
                            <h5>Buildings:</h5> 
                            Tents and lean-tos make up the majority of "buildings" in Shantytown, though some wooden structures rise up from the mess like islands in a sea of misery.

                        <p>

                            Little better than muddy paths wending through heaps of debris and filth, no one is sure if the mud is actually mud. . . .

                        <p>
                            <h5>People:</h5> 
                            People of all races and from all lands live here, though humans appear to be the most numerous. Most have hard luck stories, but a few live here by choice-for easy hunting or to escape notice.

                        <p>
                            <h5>Sights:</h5> 
                            One can see a filthy child screaming in the middle of a street, a flock of chickens fleeing from a hungry cat, a brown-clad cultist with a rat skull on a thong around his neck, a shrine dedicated to a sinister god, and a bloated corpse ripening in the sun. 
                        </p>

                            Filth, filth, and more filth-the stench of Shantytown is staggering.

                            Within this area one can hear laughter and crying, moans and sighs, the squelch of footfalls, the grunt
                            of pain, the short shriek of butchered animal, the howl of a dog in pain.

                <h3>Brindol Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Brindol has a smaller population than it
                    did before the events of the original Red Hand of Doom. But the last
                    decade has brought mild prosperity to the region,
                    with only bandits (such as Sinruth and his ilk) disturbing
                    the peace.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h5>Population:</h5> 
                    6,700; another 1,000 live within
                    a five-mile radius of the town itself. The people of
                    Brindol are mostly humans, half-elves, and dwarves.
                    The town's population swells by several hundred
                    whenever some connected halfling clans known as
                    "the river people" are in town.
                </div>
                <p>
                    <h5>Government:</h5> 
                    A town has a council, two-thirds
                    of whom are hereditary landlords and the remainder
                    of whom are guildmasters from the city's
                    important trade guilds. Lord Warden Harrik Orenna
                    is the public face of the council and commander of
                    the city militia.

                    <h5 class="fullpage">Defense:</h5> 
                    The city has 200 soldiers under arms
                    at all times, with about one-quarter on duty at any
                    given time. In times of crisis, the Lord Warden has
                    access to another 200 well-equipped but poorly
                    trained soldiers by calling up the militia.

                    Sayre is an artistic, monument-filled city built in a particularly
                    beautiful valley. Sayre holds a university and
                    a large number of artisans, making it a popular site for
                    those who deal in either information or fine art.

                <div>
                    <h5>Population:</h5> 
                    Approximately 12,000, including
                    almost 1,500 students attending the University. Most
                    inhabitants are human, elf, eladrin, or halfling. Some
                    dwarves also live in Sayre, although they tend to keep
                    to themselves.

                    <h5>Government:</h5> 
                    Sayre is governed by Lord Divian
                    Torrance, a politically astute nobleman adept at playing
                    different factions of the city against each other.
                    Power resides with Lord Torrance, as well as the Artisan's
                    Guild and the University's archdean.

                    <h5>Defense:</h5> 
                    The Guards of the March are a force of
                    100 soldiers led by General Alvro Taramin that have
                    little to do other than patrol the safer sections in and
                    around the city. Most merchants, guilds, and noble
                    families have their own mercenary guards that protect
                    their property and work together when danger
                    appears. In a time of crisis, General Taramin has the
                    authority to call on any house with its own private
                    guard to cede command of their troops directly to
                    him. Fortunately, he has never had to do so, but if he
                    were, he could call over 2,000 troops. With a cliff, a
                    lake, and steep hills protecting three sides of Sayre, the
                    Guards of the March spend much of their time outside
                    the city patrolling the farming areas to the west.

                    to the city's finest artists and artisans, and is the place to
                    go if you're looking for jewelers or sculptors. Low Mountain
                    is home to most of Sayre's dwarves, and hidden
                    weaponsmiths and armorers are available to anyone
                    who can gain a prior recommendation from a dwarf.

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    Sayre is built in a small, defensible valley. Steep hills
                    to the north provide protection from overland armies
                    and make excellent spots for small defensive guard
                    posts. The Lake of Songs sits uphill to the northwest of
                    the city. Dammed at its outflow to help control floods,
                    this lake is used year-round for fishing and recreation;
                    it is extraordinarily beautiful and the subject of many
                    paintings and tapestries by local artists. The Singing
                    River descends from the lake and splits briefly into
                    three branches as it flows through Sayre. A tall cliff
                    guards Sayre's eastern flank, dropping 200 feet to the
                    valley below. The only direction an invading army
                    could easily approach Sayre from is the west, across
                    the farms and fields, and guard towers alert the town
                    to any threat approaching from that direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before Sayre was built, the city of Auger stood on this
                    site, built over 400 years ago as a refuge for exiled diviners.
                    A diviner named Auglos and his apprentices were
                    driven from the island of Nefelus after he prophesized
                    a local noble's death and was blamed by the man's relatives.
                    After fleeing the family's wrath, Auglos settled
                    in this particularly beautiful and defensible valley to
                    continue his research into divination and communication.
                    More academics and sages slowly joined him, and a
                    small city - Auger - grew up around his tower.
                </p>
                <!-- 
                <p>
                    Auglos's skill as a craftsman began to bring him
                    fame. At first he specialized in divinatory devices
                    such as crystal balls. His masterpiece was a huge glass
                    globe the color of the evening sky, a device that could
                    transmit messages thousands of miles and even across
                    planes if individually crafted receiving mirrors were
                    first attuned to it. Auglos sold the communication
                    mirrors for extremely high prices, typically to merchant
                    consortiums or the rulers of more prosperous
                    city states. His customers never knew that if he chose,
                    he could hear and see everything that passed through
                    one of his glass devices, and that he also sold much of
                    the information he obtained through his eavesdropping,
                    resulting in an even more profitable secondary
                    business in the espionage trade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Auglos knew that his glass globe created psychic
                    ripples in the Astral Sea when it was used, but he
                    didn't consider it a problem; how likely was it that
                    anyone would be bothered? He should have done
                    more research. His master glass, the device attuned to
                    all the others that allowed him to listen in on so many
                    fascinating conversations, created ripples near the
                    githyanki city of Tu'narath, and psychic debris from
                    the glass's communication soon caught the githyanki's
                    attention. The githyanki quickly determined that
                    someone on the mortal realm was using the energy of
                    the plane to fuel a communication device. Paranoid
                    in the extreme, within three months, the Lich Queen
                    Vlaakith herself named this device the Bitter Glass
                    and decreed that the psychic pollution must be eliminated.
                    Her knights quickly carried out her orders.

                    The raid on Auger was terrible to behold. Githyanki
                    dragonriders shattered the town's dam, flooding the
                    streets with water and mud, then proceeded to pick
                    off fleeing citizens one by one. By the end of the night,
                    Auglos and his assistants were dead, and the Bitter
                    Glass was shattered and buried under the broken
                    tower that housed it. Auger's remains were looted and
                    abandoned, and survivors from the raid left the area,
                    never aware of the reason behind the attack.

                <h3>Rebuilding</h3>
                <p>
                    Shepherds moved back onto the site within sixty years,
                    but without a dam on the Singing River, the site of
                    the former city had become a flood plain whenever it
                    rained. Finally, dwarven engineers rebuilt the dam on
                    the Lake of Songs, and Sayre was built where Auger
                    once stood. The level of the land had risen after so
                    many years of floods, and none of the old buildings
                    were still visible above ground. All residents of the
                    modern city know that there is an old city beneath the
                    streets, and some families dug down to take advantage
                    of a pre-made cellar by digging through the roofs of
                    old buildings, but enough people caused cave-ins or
                    unleashed monsters that it's now illegal to dig into the
                    undercity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sayre is ruled by a wily half-elven politician
                    named Lord Divian Torrance, and under his direction
                    the city goes out of its way to attract the finest artists
                    and craftsmen in the land. As a result, many wealthy
                    families call Sayre home, and all of these have their
                    own mercenary security forces to protect their
                    houses and workshops. Not much of a public militia
                    is needed, although a small force controlled by Torrance's
                    good friend General Taramin remains active.
                    The public militia is subsidized by a public ordinance
                    crafted by the wily Lord Torrance. Each family above
                    a certain income level must commit a number of
                    troops from their own personal guard units to the
                    city's defense. This makes the city's safety the concern
                    of all the wealthiest families, although it requires a
                    charismatic and skillful general to keep all the different
                    house troops in line. Sayre boasts a small theater
                    and a large university that attracts scholars from cities
                    across this corner of the mortal realm. For such a
                    small city, Sayre is a shining beacon of light. Lord Torrance
                    fully intends to keep it that way.

                <section id="Fisher District">
                    <h4>The Fisher District</h4>
                    <p>
                        Located at the northern tip of the city, this low-lying
                        area is prone to floods during the spring rains. Fishermen
                        and fishmongers who live here ply the lake for
                        their trade and live in raised huts. It's possible to buy
                        fish in the market district, but the freshest fish can
                        be bought by those brave enough to come north up
                        muddy streets and buy the catch coming off the boats.
                        There isn't much crime in the Fisher District; most
                        fishermen have large families, and they police their
                        own neighborhood with stout clubs and many friends.
                        Interestingly, this is the one neighborhood that isn't
                        defined by the breaks of the river. Fishermen live on
                        both outer shores and both inner ones, crossing the
                        rivers in small boats or over swaying rope bridges.

                        <strong>Ketch's Catch:</strong> This small fish stand has a reputation
                        for bringing in some of the largest, tastiest
                        fish in the lake. More importantly, the stall is run by
                        Gloriana Ketch. She makes a business of tracking city
                        gossip while her husband is off fishing, and she's a
                        good source for anyone who wants to know the latest
                        city rumors about the nobles or anyone of importance.

                    <h4>Prospect Hill</h4>
                    <p>
                        This residential neighborhood holds the majority of
                        the city's grand estates and mansions. Flanked by
                        rivers on either side, the low hill rises gradually over
                        the rest of Sayre. This neighborhood was the heart
                        of the ancient City of Seers. All the richest citizens
                        of Sayre live here. There is virtually no crime here,
                        and private mercenary units ensure that the neighborhood
                        stays safe. Unsavory types moving through
                        Prospect Hill should expect to be challenged several
                        times, especially after dark.

                        <strong>The Pillar of Hope Reborn:</strong> 
                        This ostentatious
                        memorial is a 60-foot-tall pillar with an eternal, magical
                        flame atop it. According to the plaque this marks
                        the spot of "Auglos the Wise's tower in Auger, first
                        founder of the city that became Sayre." It's not particularly
                        accurate, being located almost 200 feet from
                        Telicanthus's mansion and the actual site of the tower,
                        but it's a good meeting spot for young couples on
                        Prospect Hill who wish to go courting after dark. The
                        beggars of Sayre have a yearly competition, awarding
                        50 gp to anyone of their ilk who can surreptitiously
                        climb the pillar and extinguish the flame. Guardsmen
                        usually find crippled and dead beggars under
                        the pillar for weeks afterward.

                        <strong>Telicanthus's Mansion:</strong> 
                        Marked by gate pillars
                        boasting lanterns made from exquisitely blown glass,
                        this mansion was bought by Telicanthus and renovated
                        after the former owner moved south. It's one of
                        the social epicenters of Prospect Hill, and servants
                        and guests enter and exit it during most daylight
                        hours (or later, if Telicanthus is hosting a party.) A
                        competent and wily butler (Telicanthus's <span class="hidden">sociopathic</span>
                        servant Pennel) monitors all guests and stops anyone
                        who doesn't belong. Telicanthus's guards are notably
                        polite as they escort interlopers off the property. <span class="hidden">
                        Unlike other parts of the city, none
                        of General Taramin's city militia come within three

                    <p>
                        This neighborhood on the eastern edge of Prospect
                        Hill is home to the city's artists. Sayre attracts many
                        of the finest craftsmen to this area. The wide roads
                        are lined with shops and stores, and are roughly
                        grouped by type of business. Businesses selling expensive
                        goods, such as goldmakers and jewelers, typically
                        have their own security. There's an atmosphere of
                        camaraderie in the Glassworks, and in the event of
                        trouble, all locals pitch in to solve the problem. Many
                        artists and shop owners live in apartments located
                        over their stores.

                        This is one of the finest inns
                        in the entire city, with superb service and prices to
                        match. Rooms are large, secure, beautifully decorated,
                        and extremely comfortable. The staff offers
                        any amenity a guest might want, and will send out
                        for food or items not offered in-house, and the chefs
                        are renowned for truly delicious meals. Rooms here
                        cost 15 gp a night, an outrageous amount compared
                        to other inns in the city, but rooms seldom go empty.

                        is as knowledgeable a dwarven craftsman

                        glass window's craftsman if the individual is famous
                        enough. He charges high prices for high quality art, but

                        <strong>The University of Sayre:</strong> 
                        Founded by a priestess of Ioun who was appalled with
                        the lack of learning among most people she met, the
                        university is a bustling school of higher learning that
                        teaches everything from agriculture to esoteric magical
                        theory. Students tend to be young and from out of
                        town, as the university recruits the best and brightest
                        from many different areas. The university is often
                        viewed as an excellent finishing school for noble sons
                        and daughters, and it isn't uncommon for loyal servants
                        to be seen dragging their drunken masters back
                        home after a rowdy night in the Dregs.

                        for students who want to be in stumbling distance of
                        their rooms after drinking, and for those who don't

                        have adopted the tankard as their own, as well.
                        This is the place to come if you want a philosophical

                        While most races have integrated nicely in Sayre,
                        the dwarven inhabitants tend to keep to themselves.
                        Low Mountain is a neighborhood of high stone walls
                        and twisting streets. Non-dwarves have trouble finding
                        places in Low Mountain, as none of the streets
                        are labeled, and none of the buildings are numbered
                        or named. As they say, "If you need to know where
                        you are in Low Mountain, you probably shouldn't be
                        there."
                        The area is safe, with squads formed exclusively
                        of dwarven guards patrolling the streets after
                        nightfall, but it's not particularly exciting to nondwarves.
                        That changes if you're a dwarf, or have the
                        trust of one. Wonderful restaurants, clever sages,
                        and master craftsmen hide within the featureless
                        buildings. Some dwarves will accept a bribe to guide
                        outsiders to the right place and introduce them to the
                        right contact.

                        from all walks of life, and any non-exotic object (as
                        well as many exotic and rare ones) can be purchased
                        here. Whether you're looking for ink from a giant
                        octopus or the feather from an angel, you're likely to
                        be able to buy it - or something that the seller swears
                        is authentic - somewhere in the market. This area is
                        characterized by narrow streets, tiny shop stalls, yelling
                        shopkeeps, and a multitude of different bazaars.
                        Due to the university, the market contains a great
                        number of booksellers and scrollmakers. Debt-ridden
                        sages who have been forced to sell their library
                        crouch side by side with itinerant thieves peddling
                        stolen spellbooks.

                        <strong>Rancid Agnes:</strong> 
                        This elderly beggar holds court
                        at the edge of the market. She is taken care of by
                        regulars in the market who consider it good luck to
                        throw her a few coins when they pass by. In return,
                        she is unfailingly friendly to anyone who doesn't treat
                        her with contempt. Agnes is always happy to pass a
                        few minutes chatting with strangers, and she's the
                        best resource for finding something quickly, as she
                        has a good memory for what merchant has what sort
                        of item.

                    <p>
                        The name for the farmer and tannery district is usually
                        correct, with the stink of the livestock blowing
                        away to the southwest. This district is characterized
                        by wide pens, warehouses and slaughterhouses,
                        and stockyards where herd animals are sold. On
                        the rare occasions when exotic animals or monsters
                        are brought into the city, they're kept in Downwind

                    <h4>The March</h4>
                    <p>
                        The March looks almost like a military parade ground.
                        This area was once the preferred spot for Lord Limbic
                        the Scholar, a former ruler who had an obsession with
                        statuary and monuments. As a result, he spent a great
                        deal of the city's coffers on self-aggrandizing monuments.
                        More than two dozen great statues, triumphal
                        arches to non-existent battles, and other spectacular
                        monuments stand in this area. They're starting to
                        decay somewhat due to a lack of interest in keeping
                        them pristine, but they define this section of the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Dangle:</strong> 
                        This was originally named "The
                        Triumphal Arch of Limbic the Gracious" until it was
                        turned into the city's location for public execution and
                        punishment. Murderers are hanged from the 30-foot-tall
                        arch and left to dangle for a few days. Public
                        stocks are also located here, for punishments of a less
                        severe nature. Public executions are rare in Sayre,
                        and the city hasn't seen one in months.

                        <strong>The Guard Barracks:</strong> 
                        Sayre doesn't require a
                        large standing army thanks to the proliferation of
                        private guards, but the one hundred full-time city
                        militia the city employs are stationed in this gray, austere
                        building that is also known for its statue of Lord
                        Limbic standing on the roof.

                        Most of the city's entertainment is located in this
                        rundown, old section of the city. Dancehalls, seedy
                        taverns, pawn shops, breweries, and comfort houses
                        all crowd its narrow alleys. The area isn't immediately
                        dangerous to visitors, as thugs paid by local businesses
                        roam the streets with the intent of keeping people
                        safe in the theory that "a live customer is a paying
                        customer." They've been known to look the other way
                        after dark, though, especially for a sizeable bribe.

                        been stuffed by a taxidermist and magically animated;
                        it staggers around the tavern to greet visitors.
                        The Inn of the Ugly Dog has cheap ale, mostly clean
                        rooms, good prices, and an ever-changing array of

                        These are the slums of Sayre, and the area where the
                        city's undesirables live. Beggars and unsavory visitors
                        gather here, along with anyone too poor to pay for
                        lodging elsewhere. Abandoned and crumbling warehouses
                        hold rotting goods or illegal and smuggled
                        property. The streets are narrow and twisting, made
                        slick by constant mist that rises from the waterfalls.
                        Dark and smoke-stained buildings house beggars
                        with wet coughs from the constant moisture. Rats
                        scuttling through glassless windows provide one of
                        the few free food sources for the locals. It isn't an
                        attractive place to live, and visitors who show weakness
                        are likely to be preyed upon by the locals.

                        This abandoned plaza is surrounded
                        by vacant buildings. The githzerai living in
                        Sayre have taken over one of them, reinforcing it and
                        using it as a temporary headquarters.

                        an abandoned warehouse across the street from the last
                        bridge in Sayre. Beggars congregate in this area each
                        morning before heading out across the city. The beggars,
                        strangely, won't speak to anyone while near Lowbridge.
                        They won't ask for money until they've gone to other parts
                        of town, as they're careful not to draw attention to the
                        activities of the Filth King (leader of the city's beggars).

            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <img src="places/Elsir Vale.jpg" class="left"/>
            <p>
                The world has never been a safe place. Bastions of civilization populate a dark, menacing world-islands of order and reason exist in a land 
                otherwise overrun by dark cults, vile monsters, creatures from the dark edges of the imagination, and worse.
            </p>
            <p>
                One such point of light is the Elsir Vale, a quiet frontier land bordered by mountains. 
                It is inhabited by farming communities and various small cities and towns. No monarch or ruler holds sway over the Vale; 
                each city is run by a council and manages its affairs in a state of relative peace with its neighbors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The vale stretches almost 250 miles east to west and averages about 70 miles north to south. 
                Several small mountain ranges and dense forests form the vale's borders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though the borders of the vale are mostly hills, mountains and forests, the heart of the vale is grassy plains for the most part. 
                Every town in the vale is surrounded by numerous farms. Beyond the civilized areas are vast rolling plains with infrequent hillocks and copses of trees.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elsir Vale lies in the subtropical latitudes. Summers are hot and dry (although punctuated by the occasional intense thunderstorm), 
                and winters are warm and rainy. Large stretches of the area are quite arid, and the vale is flanked by the vast savannahs stretching for mile after dusty mile. 
                The forests that stretch across most of the vale's northern reaches are stifling and sweltering hot in the summertime, with not a breath of wind to relieve 
                the oppressive heat. The largest town in the Vale is Brindol, located roughly at its center. Brindol is a 
                thriving trade community and the starting point of your adventures. It has seen its share of excitement over the years, most recently forty years ago when it 
                was the center point of a war.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the western edge of the Vale, a week's journey from Brindol, the city of Overlook and its fortress of 
                Bordrin's Watch command the only pass across the Stonehome Mountains and keep the Vale safe from the occasional 
                orc incursion from the wild, lawless lands to the west.
            </p>
            <p>
                In between, along the Dawn Way, lie a number of smaller towns that serve as market centers for outlying farming communities and host 
                various trade fairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The town of Dennovar lies to the east of Brindol, and represents the last sizable population center as the Vale 
                spreads outwards into the Golden Plains.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the east, across the Golden Plains (at least some of the time) lies the Eladrin city of Astrazalian, known 
                to residents of the Vale as the City of Starlight. This magnificent city strides the border between the mortal realm and the Feywild, 
                and exists in each for fully half of every year. During the spring and summer, it resides a few hundred miles to the east of the Vale and is the source 
                (or destination) of a significant amount of the trade that flows through the Vale.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the north, outside the borders of the Vale lie the ruins of the city of Rhest, once the center of a kingdom that spanned the entirety 
                of the vale, but now a long crumbled remnant inhabited mostly by Lizard folk and other creatures best left unmentioned.

            <h2>Ancient History</h2>
            <p>
                The scattered human towns and villages of the land now known as the Elsir Vale grew up along the Dawn Way, 
                an important east-west trade road linking the heavily settled lands that lie northwest across the Endless Plains with the exotic kingdoms 
                and goods of the coastal lands lying to the southeast.
            </p>
            <img src="places/Ancient Dwarven Kingdom.png" class="left"/>
            <p>
                Much of the Dawn Way was built by an ancient dwarven kingdom that spanned the Wyrmsmoke and Giantshield Mountains 
                more than a thousand years ago. While their kingdom is long gone, their roads, bridges, and cisterns remain in use to this day. After the kingdom passed, the presence 
                of various monsters and raiders kept traffic along the Dawn Way light for many years; few caravans dared the long and dangerous trek. 
                Few humans lived in Elsir Vale during those years - only scattered settlements of druidic folk who tapped into the rich planar magic of the Vale. 
                In the end, however, they left behind little more than grassy barrows and stone circles on the hilltops.
            </p>
            <img src="places/Rhestilor.jpg" title="Rhestilor" class="right"/>
            <p>
                About five hundred years ago, the nearby city of Rhest came to control the vale and a large swath of land north of the 
                Giantshield Mountains as well. Soldiers from Rhest secured the roads all the way to Dennovar and beyond, 
                creating a safe passage for trade. More and more traders traveled the Dawn Way, and the kingdom of Rhestilor grew wealthy 
                on the tariffs exacted from the passing merchants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under the kingdom's shield, the towns along the Dawn Way - Brindol, Dennovar, 
                Talar, Terrelton, and the rest - grew up from tiny hamlets or lonely soldiers' posts to flourishing human settlements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The kingdom of Rhestilor eventually collapsed under civil strife, monstrous incursions, and magical blights. Almost two hundred years and fifty 
                years ago, the city of Rhest was burned by a savage horde that descended swiftly from out of the Wyrmsmoke Mountains. 
                Although the warriors of Rhestilor killed much of the horde, the city was abandoned and the already weakened kingdom broken. The locks and canals 
                surrounding Rhest fell into disrepair, and the Blackfens Swamp swallowed the ruined city.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the years after the kingdom's fall, the towns of Elsir Vale came to look after themselves. Most of the local lords still held titles derived 
                from the old kingdom of Rhestilor. While everyone knew that the kings of Rhestilor were long dead, no new realm arose 
                in the Vale.

            <h2>The Red Hand of Doom</h2>
            <p>
                For centuries following the collapse of Rhestilor, the dry and dusty Wyrmsmoke Mountains were home to dozens of goblinoid 
                tribes. Although travelers were forced to skirt the goblin-infested hills by a generous margin, in general the Wyrmsmoke tribes, depleted by the battles surrounding the 
                collapse of Rhestilor, posed no significant threat to the nearby human towns and settlements other than the occasional bloody raid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet deep within the mountains lay hidden something that would spell doom - an ancient temple dedicated to Tiamat, the Queen of Evil Dragons.
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Azarr Kul.png" title="Azarr Kul" class="left"/>
            <p>
                Built hundreds of years ago to serve as the hidden redoubt of a despicable cult of dragon worshippers, the temple was eventually cleansed by a band of heroes from the city of 
                Rhest. 
                For several centuries the complex lay empty. 
                Then, eighty years ago, the young half-dragon hobgoblin warrior Azarr Kul discovered the abandoned temple and was awed by the teachings of 
                Tiamat he read on the walls therein. 
                He abandoned Maglubiyet, the traditional deity of his people, and dedicated himself to leading the rest of his nation to 
                Tiamat's worship.
            </p>
            <img src="images/Red Hand of Doom.png" class="right"/>
            <p>
                Over the next twenty years, Azarr Kul grew into a powerful warlord and a mighty priest of Tiamat. Early in his rise to 
                power he struck up an alliance with his sire, the blue dragon Tyrgarun. Aided by this powerful ally, Azarr Kul converted 
                his entire tribe into fanatical worshipers of Tiamat. He renamed the tribes that had fallen under his wing the Kulkor Zhul 
                and began to lay his plans for conquest of Elsir Vale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dedicating themselves to the Queen of Evil Dragons with the fanaticism of the recently converted, the members of the Kulkor Zhul grew strong, 
                stronger than any Wyrmsmoke tribe before them. Adopting the standard of the Red Hand, an ancient symbol of 
                Tiamat's cult, Azarr Kul created an elite caste of warpriests, monks, and dragon-favored champions to lead the 
                Kulkor Zhul.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, Azarr Kul and his dragon-worshipping zealots destroyed the last opposition to his supremacy over the Wyrmsmoke tribes, 
                slaughtering the Black Knife Goblins and the tribes allied to them in a ferocious onslaught. The survivors accepted his sovereignty and were absorbed into his realm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Azarr Kul named his new kingdom Harg Kulkor, or "Land of the Dragon."

                After a long season of rebuilding his strength, offering bribes to many of the intelligent monsters in the region, and cementing the power of his Red Hand warpriests 
                over the disparate tribes he ruled, Azarr Kul finally turned his attention to the lands beyond the Wyrmsmoke Mountains. What he saw whetted 
                his ambition for power; no city or state within hundreds of miles could field an army as strong as his. The High Wyrmlord dreamed of carving out a hobgoblin empire stretching from the 
                Sunset Sea to the Golden Plains - and the first step was to crush the human towns in Elsir Vale.
            </p>
            <p>
                The civilized folk of Elsir Vale, long used to avoiding the Wyrmsmoke Mountains, were completely unaware of the host marching upon them. 
                Kul's generals sent well trained scouts ahead to silence any that might alert the Vale to their approach.

                <h3>The Dawn Wardens</h3>
                <p>
                    But the Vale was not without its own skilled warriors. A band of adventurers who had travelled to Brindol from the City of Greyhawk in search 
                    of treasure was exploring ruins at the base of the Wyrmsmoke Mountains, Vraath Keep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These adventurers, who would in time come to be known as the Dawn Wardens (for their protection of the towns along the Dawn Way), 
                    were alerted to the presence of the army by nothing more than sheer chance of happenstance. However, this simple bit of luck would in the end prove the savior of the Vale and all its peoples.
                </p>
                <img src="places/Drellin's Forge.png" class="left"/>
                <p>
                    Realizing they simply could not fight an army by themselves, the members of the Dawn Wardens set about delaying the army in any way possible. To that end, 
                    they destroyed the ancient dwarven bridge at Skull Gorge. Upon succeeding, they immediately headed for the nearby town of Drellin's Ferry, 
                    raising the alarm and giving the people what time they could to prepare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the warnings of the Dawn Wardens saved countless lives, and the destruction of the bridge slowed the advance of Azzar Kul's host, 
                    no force in the Vale could stop it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While a few brave souls and bands of scattered soldiers managed to slow the army at a river or mountain pass, the host moved forward, bringing with it an inevitable doom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this time, the Dawn Wardens proved themselves valiant defenders of the people. They led raids on the Red Hand supply lines, 
                    garnered allies from neighboring elven and dwarven settlements, and ruined more than a few of Azarr Kul's war plans.
                </p>
                <img src="images/Siege of Brindol.png" class="right"/>
                <p>
                    As time went on though, it was evident that not even the Dawn Wardens could stop the advancing army. It spread through the eastern plains of the vale, right to the gates 
                    of Brindol. Members of the farm communities surrounding Brindol fled inside its walls for protection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The walled city was the first real obstacle the army had faced. They laid siege to the town and wore down its defenses relentlessly. Large amounts of the population of 
                    Brindol fell defending the towns walls, and countless more died of starvation and plague from the crowded conditions. It seemed that the folk of 
                    Brindol, and by extension, the Vale, were without hope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, as if by a miracle, the army of Azzar Kul tore itself apart. For no reason the people of Brindol could immediately divine, 
                    the leaders of the army suddenly began fighting amongst themselves, vying for control of the host.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The great army splintered, with large parts of its forces simply heading back to the Wyrmsmoke Mountains. In response, the forces that had rallied to the defense of 
                    the Vale quickly shifted to the offensive. Disjointed and surrounded, the goblinoid tribes were pursued, isolated, and crushed. The host of the Red Hand was no more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shortly thereafter, the Dawn Wardens reappeared, prominently displaying the body of Azarr Kul. They had skirted around the main army and 
                    ventured all the way to the Fane of Tiamat in the heart of the Wyrmsmoke Mountains, and struck directly at Azzar Kul 
                    himself. With the charismatic leader of the Red Hand dead, the various factions and tribes that made up the Kulkor Zhul fought amongst themselves for 
                    supremacy and proved their own undoing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stories of these brave heroes and their unlikely deeds spread like wildfire, spurring the good people of the Vale to further action. The military forces, as meager as they were, 
                    went on the hunt and killed thousands of the remaining goblinoids, crippling their numbers for a generation. Hunting down the more powerful members of Azzar Kul's host themselves, the 
                    Dawn Wardens defeated Tyrgarun the blue dragon, their third dragon kill in as many months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The threat was over, but the damage wreaked by the armies of the Red Hand was significant, and it would take a generation before life returned to normal. Even now, there are places in the Vale 
                    where the scars of war have not fully healed... outlying communities remain abandoned, dwarven outposts which once were manned by a few brave soldiers now lie in ruins, and the dangerous creatures 
                    that inhabit the Blackfens Swamp are bolder than they once were. Some whisper that while the Red Hand was defeated, the scales have tipped in favor of darkness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And what of the Dawn Wardens? They worked alongside their neighbors and friends, restoring what they could, until finally, there was nothing left for them to do in the Vale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They were wealthy heroes, retired adventurers, middle aged now, some with families. Several of them settled down in the Vale and lived out their years in peace. Others would never settle down, and 
                    so they moved on in search of some new adventure in far off lands, never to return to their humble birthplace in Elsir Vale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Forty years have passed since the fall of Azzar Kul, and in that time the Vale has enjoyed peace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gradually, the people spread back out into the shattered hamlets and farmsteads. Dwarven mining settlements in the foothills on the south end of the Vale expanded, and trade picked up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, the war of the Red Hand is little more than a story told by old timers to frighten schoolchildren, a fading museum with an elderly caretaker, and a local holiday occasioned by picnics and 
                    revelry.

        <article>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                50 years have passed since a small band of heroes known as the Dawn Wardens 
                broke the grasping claws of the Red Hand and saved the civilized settlements of the 
                Elsir Vale from conquest and ruin. Peace has reigned for a generation and the cities 
                of the vale have once again grown prosperous on renewed trade routes following the Dawn Way. 
                Growth has been steady, but some of the scars of the past have yet to fade.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Now war comes again to the idyllic vale, but the heroes of old have passed into memory and legend; 
                yet their legacy remains to answer the call to arms: Our new heroes are all the children, relatives, or students of 
                members of the Dawn Wardens. Having inherited the skill and wanderlust that afflicted their 
                forebears, they leave their homes in defense of the vale against the orcish hordes rumored to be approaching from the 
                savage plains beyond the western mountains. Though many of the simple folk spread throughout the vale dismiss the idea 
                of war raging anew, you know better, and interruptions in the trade along the Dawn Way have 
                caused the less stoic to begin voicing concern.
            </p> 
            <img src="npcs/Axenhaft Security.png" class="left"/>
            <p>
                Seeking coin to pay for arms and armor on their way to the front, our heroes join the company of worried merchant caravans 
                headed west along the Dawn Way to Brindol, acting as guards. Passing 
                occasional farms and hamlets the caravan guard slowly grows, gradually accruing new recruits, many of whom they've met through 
                the fraternity of their formerly adventuring relatives or masters. In the days spent following the sun, former acquaintances 
                have coalesced into a group of fast friends, trading posts with others until you all travel together with the same caravan in 
                the employ of Axenhaft Security.
            </p>
            <p>
                Talk passes along the road from traveler to traveler and news of an upcoming midsummer festival in Brindol 
                dominates the gossip. Supposedly the festival marks the anniversary of the Dawn Warden's defeat of the 
                Red Hand. Many say that the highlight of the annual festival is an urban footrace commemorating the grueling 
                marathon run by the heroes of that war to warn the people of Brindol of the impending attack. Entry is open 
                to all, the race draws a heavy crowd, and rumor has it the winner draws a heavy purse and possibly a prize of magic. Some hopeful 
                travelers boast of their intent to enter and win, despite worries of some underhanded tactics used by competitors in the past.  
                The excitement is catching and as a team our heroes plan to enter the race and divide the winnings among themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just as they shake on the arrangement the caravan turns a bend in the road around a lazy hillock and the jovial camaraderie is broken 
                by the sound of screams and drawn steel. After a short and brutal skirmish with a large group of well-armed goblins 
                <span class="future">Tusk's scouts armed by Modra with Sarshan's weapons</span>, 
                the merchants in the caravan lay dead, leaving our heroes unemployed but with a wagon full of goods to finance the race entry.

            <h2>The Race</h2>
            <img src="places/Brindol magical quarter.png" class="left"/>
            <img src="places/Brindol river.png" class="right"/>
            <p>
                Brindol was in the middle of celebrating the anniversary of the victory over the Red Hand of Doom. 
                The pinnacle of the celebration is the cross city race and the town is alive with talk about it. 
                The race is held every year on the same day. 
                The goal is to take a letter from the southern gate to the northern watchtower as quickly as possible.
                While the race started out as a competition between two message carriers and a celebration of the city's history, it is now open to anyone. 
                There are loose rules about the use of magic and physical violence between competitors but it is, for the most part, a free-for-all with almost anything being considered "fair". 
                The race is also open to interference from the citizens. 
                Many bands of children, ruffians, and the bored delight in setting "traps" for the racers and watching them take a tumble.
                The prize for this punishing race is coin and the added inducement of a magical item from the treasury.
            </p>
            <p>
                The favored competitors were: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Dorion Light-Step, an elven ranger from the nearby woodlands, venturing out in the world and seeking to make a name for himself</li>
                    <li>Garth Cooper, a member of the local watch, young and arrogant and looking to win in order to bump himself up the ranks and to impress a girl he likes very much</li>
                    <li>Two-Teeth, a brute named after the teeth he lost after being kicked by a wild horse, is a half-orc barbarian who is traveling through Brindol on his way to somewhere else.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The rules were simple:
                <ul>
                    <li>Participants in the race must be present two hours after first light at the southern gate.</li>
                    <li>Participants must not begin running until the gate portcullis hits the ground.</li>
                    <li>Participants may not directly attack another runner with magic or arms. Roughhousing, wrestling, and bare-hands brawling are permitted.</li>
                    <li>Participants must travel on foot (or their species equivalent). Mounts, magical travel, flying more than a few feet at a time, and any other forms of movement that the judges 
                        deem to be cheating will get the racer disqualified.</li>
                    <li>The first one to hand their letter to the town elder at the top of the northern watchtower is the winner and will be awarded the prize. The elder's decision is final in the event of 
                        an apparent tie.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The crowds cheered as the contestants lined up just inside the southern gate, sizing each other up. 
                With a great deal of gravitas, Kartenix, the captain of the watch passes before each contestant, bows, and presents them with a small scroll bound up with red ribbon - 
                the message to be delivered at the end of the race. 
                With this accomplished, he paces to the side of the starting line and raises a bright red handkerchief and waves it furiously like a flag to signal the guards. 
                After a moment there is a loud "CLANG!" right behind the runners as the portcullis drops. The race had begun!
            </p>
            <p>The race ran across the rooves and streets of the magical, poor and wealthy quarters, through ship rigging and across barges on the river, and past crowds in the market and cart pileups on the bridge.</p>
            <p>
                To win the race, one needs to clamber to the top of the northern watchtower and hand their letter to the town elder. 
                The tower is old and craggy and many of the bricks look loose. 
                Pigeons roost amongst the nooks and crannies and the stone is stained white with their droppings in many places, incongruous clumps of wild grasses and flowers sprouting from unlikely places amongst the brickwork.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a tight race, Melvin was first to press the crumpled and illegible note into the town elder's hand and who raised his arm triumphantly, proclaiming him to be the winner and ringing the alarum bell that hangs in the tower. 
                As it peeled, a great cheer went up from the crowd and the town crier solemnly stepped forward to present Melvin's prize, a fine pair of boots that twinkled with the glow of magic and a small but weighty coffer of gold.

            <h2>Rescue at Rivenroar</h2>
            <img src="tactical/Bar Fight!.png" class="left"/>
            <p>
                After the race, our heroes are celebrating in the Antler and Thistle tavern, flirting with their waitress Alys, when the gentle hubbub of the evening was shattered by the crack of the front door flying off its hinges 
                to land amid the nearest tables. Four hobgoblins rushed into the bar, swords outstretched to skewer the nearest bar patrons.
            </p> 
            <blockquote>
                "For Sinruth! For the Hand!"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                they cried.
            </p>
            <p>A fight ensued and our heroes quickly dispatched the intruders, but the scuffle left several patrons dead and the tavern aflame.</p>
            <img src="tactical/The Ogre Bombardier.png" class="right"/>
            <p>
                Our heroes organized a bucket brigade to douse the flames, only to be interrupted by shouts in the distance. As they approach the shouts resolve into a throng of townsfolk running around the street corner to the north, fleeing a curious sight: a full-grown ogre pulling a wagon by a yoke around its waist. The ogre held a cask in one hand and a massive club in the other. Riding atop the wagon were two hobgoblins with bows. The ogre tossed casks of flaming pitch into other buildings in the neighborhood.
            </p>
            <p>After a harrowing battle with the ogre where our heroes turned the explosive casks against the ogre a crowd gathered and more guards arrived a few minutes later. They immediately ask for the party's help defending the bridge, but by the time they reach the bridge, the invading band had already retreated.</p>
            <p>The residents of Brindol spent the rest of the night putting out the fires that the goblins set, tended to the wounded, and kept a nervous watch from the ramparts.</p>

            <p>
                The next morning, the full extent of the attack was known: the invaders looted the Hall of Great Valor and kidnapped several citizens, dragging them off into the hills. Among the kidnappees were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jalissa, a pretty acolyte of Ioun and alchemist, but a woman without the spine for such trauma, making her hysterical.</li>
                <li>Sertanian, the castellan of the Hall of Great Valor and a former soldier during the Red Hand invasion. Then well into his eighties he was hard, weathering the event with dignity.</li>
                <li>Thurann, the 8-year-old of Kartenix the guard captain, was brave and observant, handling the event better than many of the adults and stealing food for Jalissa.</li>
                <li>Mirtala, a middle-aged cook with claustrophobia, went nearly catatonic while held in a crypt with dire rats.</li>
                <li>Zerriska, an herbalist and self-described "witch" in her seventies, managed to bluff her captors into giving her a wide berth.</li>
                <li>Adronsius, a dwarven alchemist with an attitude, he suffered severe, repeated beatings at the hands of his captors thanks to the racial enmity between dwarves.</li>
                <li>Kartenix, the captain of the Brindol city guard and father of Thuran, fought his captors and met an early death at the hands of the goblins' pet ettercaps.</li>
            </ul>  
            <p>
                Among the stolen treasures were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ornate, gilded dragoncrest helm</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                However, the city guard had managed to capture one of the invaders alive: a hobgoblin named Morrik held in the city stocks, bruised, covered in rotten tomatoes but bandaged and alive.
            </p>
            <p>
                With their local fame from the race and their proven valor against the invaders, the Brindol town council requested our heroes' assistance in rescuing its kidnapped citizens and recovering the stolen treasures. 
                After forcefully questioning Morrik our heroes learn that the leader of the goblins was a hobgoblin named Sinruth and he eventually wanted to raise an army and carve out a fiefdom of his own. 
                The goblins were using catacombs under the ruins of Castle Rivenroar as a base for now. Morrik and the other hobgoblins were ordered to take prisoners during the raid to give to the "undead horrors" that guard part of the goblins' lair. 
                Morrik draws a crude map of the mountain path that leads to Castle Rivenroar.
                From her knowledge of history, Festivus surmises that Sinruth and the goblins see themselves as descendants of the Red Hand horde that menaced Brindol years ago, but it was also apparent to a student of history that they have no actual connection with the historic Red Hand. 
                They were flying the Red Hand insignia upside-down, for starters.

            <p>
                Following Morrik's map with Lechonero tracking the goblins, our heroes arrived at the ruins of Rivenroar Castle, a former tiefling stronghold from the ancient kindgom of Rhestilor. 
                Almost nothing remained above ground of the fortress, but our heroes descended into the open catacombs, facing goblins, gnome skulks, dire rats, ettercaps, and ancient traps.
                Among the magical curiosities in the catacombs was a dim "picture" in the middle of a room showing flickering images of a sinister tower in the middle of a shadowy swamp 
                <span class="future">what our heroes would later discover to be a one-way portal to Umbraforge</span>.
                Our heroes liberated Thurann, Mirtala, Zerriska, and Adronsius, but were too late to save Kartenix.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Rivenroar finish level.png" class="right"/>
            <p>
                Passing down to the lower levels, our heroes liberated Sertanian and Jalissa - who instantly attached herself to Richard D'Eversholt - and eventually confronted Sinruth himself. 
                After dispatching the hobgoblin, our heroes recovered the looted treasures from the Hall of Great Valor in a nearby crypt and a lightning whip and a suspicious note from Sinruth's person 
                indicating a patron <span class="future">later discovered to be Modra acting on Sarshan's behalf</span>:
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Sinruth.png" class="left" />
            <blockquote>
                <p>Brave Sinruth,</p>
                <p>The Red Hand will rise again! The other remnants take great cheer in your recent attacks on commerce coming into The Blight That is Brindol.</p>
                <p>We're particularly pleased with your ability to inspire a fighting spirit in others, whether they have true goblin blood or merely wish they did. To be blunt, we think you should have many more soldiers under your command. Many, many more.</p>
                <p>And recent events have rendered some remnants leaderless. With a bold stroke on your part, the remnants would rally to the Red Hand you so proudly display.</p>
                <p>
                    As your bold stroke, do this: Attack the The Blight That is Brindol by night. Focus your efforts on their Hall of
                    Great Valor, for it mocks the many hard-won victories by the first Red Hand of Doom. Take from them the spoils
                    of war they shamelessly hang on their walls and bring those antiques back to Rivenroar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do this before the moon is next full. And with regard to your previous question, turning over captives to your
                    unliving allies at Rivenroar is perfectly acceptable. War sometimes makes strange bedfellows, and we appreciate
                    how you've united such disparate forces under your banner. Whatever prisoners you take from Rivenroar you can
                    give to the wight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fight with the valor of your ancestors, Sinruth. And keep your hands stained red with the blood of the weak!
                    I will visit you again next month, at a time of my choosing.
                </p>

            <p>
                After our heroes returned the surviving hostages and the recovered treasures to Brindol, Richard D'Eversholt retired from the party to settle down with Jalissa and assist Sertanian
                running the Hall of Great Valor and establishing a proper temple to his god Bahamut in the town. The rest of the party continued on to the city of Overlook in the west to join the 
                battle against the invading orc hordes.

            <h2>The Siege of Bordrin's Watch</h2>
            <p>
                The lands west of the Stonehome Mountains have been a festering mire of want and suffering. 
                This parched and barren landscape is suited only for orcs, goblinoids, and other fell creatures. 
                From time to time, a warlord gathers a small army and tumbles
                out of these badlands to test their strength and arms
                against the stalwart dwarf defenders, but never have
                they crossed the mountains because straddling its
                single pass is an ancient dwarven stronghold named
                Bordrin's Watch. No matter how many orcs muster,
                they die upon its walls, painting the sturdy stone
                with their black blood. So the rumors of a new host
                in these forlorn bogs and dead woods seemed a small
                threat - nothing the guardians could not handle. This
                army, though, was different. Unlike all the many times
                the orcs have emerged, they now had a leader who
                could keep them together long enough to win.
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Tusk and Myrissa.png" class="left"/>
            <p>
                The orc leader was an overlarge warrior and chieftain
                named Tusk. Not a true orc, he had the blood of
                ogres in his veins, which made him larger, tougher,
                and eminently more dangerous. Having slaughtered
                half a dozen orc chieftains, he drew together the
                unruly tribes to mount an offensive against Bordrin's
                Watch to lay claim to the soft lands beyond its walls.
                Tusk knew the history of the Stonehome Mountains
                well, knowing that unless he could find some way to
                bypass the fortress in the mountains, it wouldn't matter
                how many warriors he commanded since he would fail.
                What Tusk needed was a way around the fortress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ever resourceful and with numerous contacts and
                allies, Tusk turned to his occasional lover and advisor,
                a shadar-kai witch named Myrissa. He sent her back
                to the Shadowfell to recruit allies to help his cause,
                and a short time later she returned with a small army
                of dark ones, led by a mysterious and sinister dark
                creeper, known as the Emissary - <span class="future">later our heroes discovered this to be Modra, a rogue lieutenant of Sarshan</span>. This leader offered
                to assist Tusk in exchange for an exclusive arrangement
                in which they would supply Tusk's armies with
                weaponry for whatever price the dark creeper and
                his fellows asked, and in exchange, the dark creepers
                would find a way through the mountains. Tusk readily
                agreed and paid the exorbitant price, gaining a
                fine arsenal, and also, he hoped, the key to victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not long after, the dark creepers returned and
                revealed a number of tunnels burrowed beneath the
                mountain. They showed the chieftain the locations of
                each, explaining how the passages connected one side
                of the mountains to the other. No tunnel was large
                enough to accommodate his entire army, so, Tusk
                gave his horde their marching orders, sending them
                to climb the mountain slopes, while his scouts moved
                ahead to secure the tunnels and prepare the way for
                Tusk and his elite warriors to strike the fortress from
                below.
            </p>
            <p>
                War approaches. A week ago, a call to arms sounded
                throughout the Elsir Vale, summoning warriors to help
                defend Bordrin's Watch in the Stonehome Mountains far to
                the west. Word of an army of orcs on the march had spread
                through the Vale for months, but now, it appeared the
                rumors were true.
            </p>
            <img src="places/Overlook.png" class="right"/>
            <p>
                Our heroes, along with militia groups and other adventurers
                from all over the Vale, marched west until they came to
                the city of Overlook, a large fortified community raised
                by dwarves centuries ago. 
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/The Freeriders.png" class="left"/>
            <p>
                Once there, our heroes and two other adventuring parties (the Farstriders and the Freeriders)
                were invited to Caer Overlook and the High Hall, there to attend the Council of Elders. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Standing on the 20-foot tall dais are the
                five elders. Each of the three male dwarves have long
                beards that hang to their feet, and two are old, being
                gray and wrinkled. The third is younger, with black
                hair and hard features. The two female elders are
                both attractive, one with red hair and the other with
                brown. All five wear the robes of their office - luxuriant
                purple and silver damask. Arranged beneath
                them, filling the chamber completely, is a motley
                crowd of common soldiers, militia, and adventurers,
                with each race and occupation represented, and most
                standing in small groups, but a few mingling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The youngest male elder spoke:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Welcome to High Hall friends. I am Elder Cadrick. I don't
                    much see the point in bandying words, so I'll lay it out for
                    you. War is upon us. A great host of orcs comes from the
                    west. Their intention is clear. They will come through the
                    mountains bent on slaughter. Those they spare can look
                    forward to a short life of slavery. Overlook, and Bordrin's
                    Watch in the mountains, have long held fast against these
                    raids, but our scouts say never has such an army gathered.
                    Thus, we turn to you brave souls to help defend not only
                    Overlook, but also all the Elsir Vale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the orcs arrive, we're certain they will come up
                    through the pass. We know this because already there have
                    been attacks from the tunnels below, compromising the
                    fastness. The defenders have fought back the savages, but
                    it's clear the rest are coming and fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So here's the plan. Durkik Forgeheart will lead the
                    militias and most of you to bolster Bordrin's Watch. Orc
                    trailblazers infest the tunnels below, so we've tasked their
                    security to the Farstriders. One more mission remains,
                    though. We need a group to evacuate the monastery on
                    the other side of the mountains. It's dangerous work, what
                    with the orcs and all, but priests need a warning of what's
                    coming if they don't know already.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do we have any volunteers?
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <img src="maps/Monastery of the Sundered Chain.png" class="left"/>
            <img src="maps/Monastery of the Sundered Chain depths.png" class="right"/>
            <p>
                From Elder Cadrick our heroes learned the Bordrin's Watch had already been compromised - 
                advanced parties of orcs had uncovered the tunnels
                beneath the mountains and were already coming through            
                to harass supply trains and reinforcements bound for the
                fortress. The Council asked our heroes and the other groups to
                descend into these tunnels, clear them out, and seal them
                off before the main host of the enemy army arrived. For
                their efforts, the Council promised to pay each group 1,000
                gp upon their return. Our heroes headed to the old Monastery
                of the Sundered Chain to the southwest, where they
                could gain access to the tunnels below, while the Farstriders heads
                for Bordrin's Watch to secure those passages, and the Freeriders
                to the Vents.
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Kalad.png" class="left"/>
            <p>
                At the Monastery of the Sundered Chain our heroes overcame a small contingent of Orog before descending into the depths below the upper temple.
                Fighting past elite troops lead by the champion Og while Festivus surfed down a subterranean cliff face on her disc, 
                the party closed the tunnels the orcs were using and rescued the few remaining survivors hiding in the works 
                including the paladin Kalad. Kalad had already closed the tunnels under Bordrin's Watch when the orcs approached, but his unit was overwhelmed attempting 
                the same here. Despite his injuries Kalad insisted our heroes accompany him directly to the Vents to make sure the last tunnels are sealed, doubting the 
                Farstrider's success at the task:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                There's too much at stake, friends! It's a labyrinth down there [at the Vents], easy to get turned
                around. Would you risk the lives of everyone in that
                valley on the efforts of just one group?
                How can we forget the suffering of our kin during the Age of Chains? How can we
                set aside those ancient grudges when the risk of slavery is now greater than ever?
                Fellow warriors, the orcs are upon us, marching once more to the beat of the giants'
                drum. It falls to us to stop them - to hold fast no matter their numbers. If we falter,
                we give into fear. It's not just ourselves and our way of life that will suffer; all people
                of the Elsir Vale will perish as well. War is upon us. Now is the time for men and
                women of courage to stand up and defend those who cannot defend themselves.
            </blockquote>               
            <img src="tactical/The Vents.png" class="right"/>
            <p>
                Following Kalad, our heroes head to the Vents to back up the Farstriders. Scattered across the lower slopes are numerous steaming
                fissures, some as small as tiny cracks in the stone with
                others large enough to accommodate an ogre. The rocks
                there are slippery and aside from ropes of brown-black
                fungus, moss, and lichen, nothing lives here. The air stinks
                of sulfur and grows stronger nearest the plumes of acrid
                smoke wafting up from the holes.
            </p>
            <p>
                About a hundred feet down from the lowest cracks was
                a campsite. There, our heroes saw five horses tied up and empty
                feedbags hanging from their heads. 
                Putting his tracking skills to work Lechonero found a smothered 
                campfire sat a few yards away from the horses and five different 
                sets of footprints leading into one of the larger openings with no sign of any prints coming out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Karrion's keen sense of Dungeoneering led the party successfully through the warren of natural caverns 
                leading to the Vents proper. There the doors opened on a platform overlooking an enormous
                chamber. A group of orcs turned to face our heroes, growling with
                rage and drooling with anticipation for the kill. Behind and
                below the orcs lay a sunken section of the chamber, where
                iron tubes as tall as a man ran across the room.
                Iranda - a dark creepr wearing a long black cloak - was
                examining an iron wheel connected to the southern pipe.
                On the north side of the pit several large beetles milled about,
                their mottled hides glowing red as if aflame.
            </p>
            <p>
                After dispatching the opposition, our heroes recovered an odd brass key from Iranda's body.
                Searching the area, the ill foreshadowing from the campsite proved true as they discovered 
                the bodies of the Farstriders - partially eaten by the orc's pet cave troll. 
                <span class="future">Jen, the half-elf warlock of the Farstriders was killed by Iranda herself.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nexus of the Vents was a massive chamber in which
                the ceiling rises 100 feet above the entrance. At the
                center of the chamber was a pillar of solid
                steel that was screwed into the stone and that
                stood as tall as the ceiling. Two bronze and
                steel pipes emerged from the eastern walls
                and traveled toward the steel column before
                vanishing into the stone. Rising around
                the outside of the room was a stone catwalk
                that connected to steel grating that wrapped
                around the steel pillar like scaffolding.
                Dark tunnels pocked the walls, leading to who
                knows where. The faint odor of sulfur
                permeated the room and the stone around the base of the
                steel column was dark, as if damp.            
            </p>

            <p>
                As our heroes ascended the ramps around the outside of the room 
                waves of orcs began pouring from the tunnels to block their path. 
                Melvin charged ahead, sweeping orcs off the edge to their deaths, 
                but was brought up short as the leaders of the invasion - 
                Tusk and Myrissa themselves - emerged from the tunnels and Tusk 
                quickly left Melvin unconscious and bleeding out. Lechonero made a 
                daring swing across the room to rescue Melvin. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Trapped by a seemingly endless horde of orcs, our heroes activated the release 
                mechanism at the top of the Nexus, quickly flooding the chamber with a flood of 
                boiling water stored from the vapor of the Vents and effectively sealing the tunnels. 
                But the mechanism also locked the escape hatch at the top Nexus and our heroes had to race against time to 
                puzzle out the dwarven runes to unlock the hatch and escape before they boiled alive.

            <h2>The Shadow Rift of Umbraforge</h2>
            <p>
                Previously our heroes discovered that
                dark creepers had sold arms and tactical intelligence
                to the orc war chief Tusk, aiding him in his attack
                against the folk of the Stonehome Mountains. 
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Sarshan.png" title="Sarshan" class="left"/>
            <p>
                Sarshan is an opportunistic shadar-kai arms
                dealer. For years, he has built an invisible mercantile
                empire around the sale and brokering of weapons,
                armor, mercenaries, and intelligence from his domain
                in the Shadowfell.
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Modra.png" title="Modra" class="right"/>
            <p>
                In the past Modra (a lieutenant of the blackmarket arms dealer Sarshan) was approached by Tusk's advisor Myrissa, a shadar-kai
                witch who knew of Sarshan's operations. However,
                the success of Sarshan's arms running and mercenary
                services turned on his ability to maintain a low profile
                in his dealings with clients in the world. Sometimes
                this meant turning down jobs that run too much risk of
                exposure. Tusk's massive raid, aimed at the heart of the
                civilized frontier and a stone's throw from Sarshan's
                operations in the city of Overlook, was one of these.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Sarshan rebuffed Myrissa's request, Modra
                approached the witch in secret. He struck a deal to
                supply Tusk with weapons and intelligence, sending
                in a group of his followers (the dark creepers in the Vents, including Iranda) to do the job.
                In going behind Sarshan's back, Modra expected that
                an overwhelming orc victory (won with the help of
                dark one subterfuge) would win his master's respect.
                However, with Tusk's forces routed and Modra's servants
                scattered or killed, the dark creeper had to
                go to ground to escape Sarshan's wrath. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Trapped in the natural world, Modra needed to reclaim Iranda's brass key - a key to a secret portal back to the Shadowfell.
                As our heroes began investigating the purpose of the key back in Overlook, Modra heard word of their efforts and 
                hired the "Lost Ones" assassins to eliminate our heroes and retrieve the key. 
                Underestimating the party, they not only survive the assassins' attack but manage wrest Modra's name from the survivor.  
                Asking around about "Modra", our heroes learned the following:
                <blockquote>

                            is there's more trouble on the march. Just like
                            Tusk's clan, the rabble of the mountains are getting
                            their hands on good-grade weapons and armor, and
                            they're looking to use it."

                            a few months past, but there's more cults than
                            that on the rise across the frontier."

                Ensorcelled by a magical tankard she discovered in the

                But losing one member the party finds 
                another character making similar lines of inquiry
                regarding the dark creeper Modra. The woman wore brown leather
                beneath a green cloak, and a longbow is slung across her
                chest. Quietly, she said

            <blockquote>
                "I've heard word that there's a group
                in the city looking for someone named Modra. I'm doing the

                This was Reniss,
                sister of the half-elf warlock Jen of the Farstriders. When Jen was
                slain in the Vents, she used a sending
                stone to whisper her last words to her sister, a name
                the Farstriders tripped across before they were cut

                "I met a dark creeper close to death in the Clean Sheets,
                looking like he'd been in the fight to end them all. He said
                he'd been working for this Modra when it happened. For
                a quart of bad beer, he told me that if I was looking for
                Modra, I'd better be fast. Someone else is hunting him - 
                someone looking to kill him. The creeper didn't know where
                Modra was, but he'd heard him talk about some Tradetown
                almshouse called the Happy Beggar."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Our heroes follow Reniss' clues to Tradetown, and the Happy Beggar, 
                a single-story almshouse sandwiched between a warehouse
                block and a section of rundown tenements. What
                no one outside of a small number of dark one and
                shadar-kai operatives knew at the time is that the almshouse
                is owned by Sarshan, and it conceals the heart of his
                arms-running enterprise within the city.

                Prashant and his wife Ausma ran the Happy Beggar
                on the proceeds of their former life as adventurers, 
                unaware of the real purpose of the building.
                The atmosphere inside the Beggar was as dingy as the
                whitewash on the outside walls. A plain common room
                sits two dozen miserable-looking patrons, most asleep in
                their chairs or sipping at cracked mugs. A few
                double as volunteer staff, carrying steaming teapots from
                table to table. Behind what would be a bar in any other
                establishment, a dour-looking human woman in white
                robes boils water at a wood stove. A similarly attired male
                greets you as he limps up a flight of stairs across the room.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Among the sorry lot taking refuge at the Beggar our heroes discover Kallista,
                rescued by Prashant and Ausma from the gutter at the end of a near-terminal bender.
                While investigating, our heroes talked to an old man alone in a rickety chair, 
                a hunched form in a tattered cloak. The old man appeared human or half-elf,
                but his face was deeply scarred by the ravages of disease. He coughs wetly
                into a grimy handkerchief and introduces himself as Brenat:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "I know the one you mean. A dark creeper, and none
                as dark as him, or so I've heard. Time was, he used
                the Happy Beggar as a meeting place, but I'd reckon
                he hasn't been seen here in two years or more. I ran
                him off one time myself. I might not look it, but I
                fought dark creepers in the mountains as a younger
                man, sellsword to a dozen lords. Much as yourselves,
                I'd wager. Adventurers all have a price, eh?"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This man was actually Sarshan in disguise, in Overlook on business and hunting Modra. 
                When he deduced our heroes' intent, he figured he could have them take care of Modra 
                for him:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Wherever you find this Modra, heed me. He's a black-hearted
                one - make no mistake and strike no bargains with him. Kill
                him quickly before he gets the chance to return the favor."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Sarshan was not aware that our heroes possessed Iranda's key, and to his surprise they 
                infiltrated his smuggling route in the basement of the Happy Beggar.
                Desperate to escape Sarshan, Modra did the same a step ahead of the party and stole another key from 
                one of Sarshan's underlings to pass through the portal into the Shadowfell. 
                Hot on Modra's heels, the party used Iranda's key to 
                open the portal to Umbraforge, Sarshan's base of operations in the Shadowfell.

            <p>
                Modra left a trap on the portal that delayed the party's pursuit, 
                and they arrive alone on the outskirts of Umbraforge, Sarshan's 
                domain in the Shadowfell.

                The land before our heroes was like nothing they'd ever seen before.
                A wide plain of gray-green grass and stunted black trees
                spread beneath a sky scoured by fast-moving clouds. The
                sun was bright above but somehow didn't cut the darkness
                that drapes every rock and every blade of grass in gray
                gloom. It was the Shadowfell.
                From the mouth of the cavern, a wide and well-traveled
                road runs in a curving line to the north. There, perhaps a
                quarter-mile away, a military camp spread. Buildings were
                scattered here and there, with tents and pavilions spreading
                between them. Torches and fires burned brightly against the
                ever-present shadow, and lone trees and tall stands of graygreen
                grass were whipped by a hissing wind.
                Looming above it all, a rise of black rock to the west was
                rent by a seething volcanic rift. Black-streaked lava coursed
                from it to descend into a narrow channel, and a permanent
                pall of glowing red-black smoke rose above it. Over this
                molten flow, a great stone bridge arched. This wide eastwest
                road met the road north from the cavern. North of
                the bridge, a tall tower stood and a lower building spread
                in its shadow.
            </p>
            <img src="places/Umbraforge markets.png" title="Umbraforge" class="right"/>
            <p>
                The party approached the frontier of the mercenary camps
                unchallenged, and a virtual city spread out before them.
                Beneath patched canvas tents stood open-air taverns,
                market stalls, apothecaries and herbalists, weaponsmiths
                and armorers, butchers and greengrocers - all doing
                roaring trade.
                Training grounds opened up between the various camps,
                and soldiers of different races clashed against each other with
                sword and shield. In the quieter corners, they saw combat
                casters training - the flare of arcane fire dancing between
                them. But as they approached, they noticed with surprise that
                these were not Shadowfell mercenaries for the most part.
                Though shadar-kai and dark ones are well represented,
                the fields and camps were packed with orcs and hobgoblins,
                ogres and trolls, lizardfolk and kobolds and a dozen other
                monstrous races of the world.

                Searching the camps for Modra, our heroes come across the following information:

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "This is Umbraforge, dominion of Sarshan, a
                    trader of great reputation and even greater
                    wealth. The tower, foundry, and forges are
                    his. The camps are those of the mercenaries
                    and slaves whose services he sells across the
                    Shadowfell and the world."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Sarshan is shadar-kai, an outcast who made
                    a name for himself as the leader of a legendary
                    mercenary band known as the Black Arrow.
                    At their height, the Arrow put so much
                    fear in generals and kings alike that Sarshan
                    would take payment to fight for one group,
                    then take a bigger payment from their foe to
                    stand down."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Modra is known well in Umbraforge, but for
                    all the wrong reasons now. He was one of
                    Sarshan's trusted lieutenants before he tried
                    to a broker a weapons deal that Sarshan had
                    already turned down."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The job that Sarshan refused was some orc
                    king's raid on a dwarven citadel. Sarshan
                    never makes a sale if it has a chance of coming
                    back to him, and for good reason. This
                    job went bad, they say, and people know that
                    Modra sold the orc his weapons."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Modra is long gone from Umbraforge and
                    the Shadowfell, believe me. Sarshan's got a
                    long arm and a longer memory. The creeper
                    would have to be crazy to come back here."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The foundry is the new jewel of Sarshan's
                    operations. Its power comes from the fire and
                    shadow driving its furnaces. Sarshan's sages
                    create beasts of battle there, born killers with
                    magic in their blood."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It used to be that Sarshan brokered mercenaries
                    mostly within the Shadowfell, but that's
                    changing. Dark ones and shadar-kai are still
                    his elite troops, but more and more, he brings
                    creatures from the world to Umbraforge for
                    training, then marches them off to places
                    unknown."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The Shadowfell is only a stopping-off place for
                    Sarshan's mercenaries. A force of archons from
                    the Elemental Chaos was here not six months
                    ago. I saw githzerai from the Astral Sea in Umbraforge
                    once. I don't know what job they took
                    for Sarshan, but woe be to whoever got in their
                    way."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Sarshan's slave bazaar is about more than just
                    servants and soldiers. His experiments in the
                    foundry only begin with dumb beasts. He's
                    building new soldier races there, born from the
                    slaves he traffics."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Sarshan's mercenary operations have tripled
                    in size in months past, but it's not the Shadowfell
                    they're fighting in. When his forces are
                    bought and sent on the march, they're bound
                    for portals to the world. Shadar-kai, dark ones,
                    undead, giants, ogres, trolls, gnolls, orcs -
                    Sarshan has the armies of two planes on the
                    march. War is brewing in the world, but the
                    forces that will fight it are moving into position
                    in the Shadowfell, unseen."

            <p>
                Eventually our heroes were approached by the shadar-kai witch 
                Leena, a lieutenant of Sarshan's and a former friend of Modra's. 
                She wore a black cloak edged with
                adamantine beads, and she kept her long hair plaited to
                hang down her back. Gold piercings lined her ears and lower
                lip, and a black starburst tattoo enclosed her right eye. She has the
                following to say:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Modra and I worked together for a time, but when he
                elected to go behind Sarshan's back, I told him we were
                done. I heard word of him in the camps even before you
                started asking around. He has a plan to disrupt Sarshan's
                operations by destroying the foundry, then the tower.
                Sarshan has a private tunnel connecting the two, and
                Modra is planning on venting the foundry's destructive
                energy there. A mass of mercenaries is moving out tonight.
                He'll be using that as cover when he goes inside.
                "Modra's made his bargain with fate, and honor decrees
                that he die for his betrayal. He won't get tears from me. But
                if Sarshan captures him, he'll die slowly. If it's you, I'll hope
                you make it quick."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Trailing Modra to the dark foundry, our heroes heard a claxon call of horns 
                sound out from the west. A haze of
                red light glimmered against the clouds as the cascade of the
                magma shadow rift flared. As Leena predicted, a huge force
                of mercenaries was on the move, heading out along the east
                road. The area around the foundry was deserted; the guards
                at the tower and the bridge had turned eastward to watch
                as Sarshan's forces moved out. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Inside the foundry the red glow of the lava trench was shrouded by shifting
                clouds of shadow and steam. Huge stone vats with steel
                doors lined both sides of this massive chamber, where
                great arrangements of pipes and vents connected them.
                Half the creatures inside the vats are humanoids mutated into horrible
                warlike forms, their skin growing spiky armor plates,
                their hands turned to razor-sharp claws, and so on.
            </p>
            <img src="images/Umbraforge foundry.png" title="Umbraforge foundry" class="right"/>
            <p>
                Two squads of what looked like hobgoblins, their bodies
                seemingly cloaked in shadow, worked there, supervised
                by another cloaked figure. They worked busily at two
                sections of pipe that diverted and channeled the lava flow.
                Closer to the door, two other shadowgoblins stood guard.
                Disguised as one of his minions, Modra spotted our heroes, 
                snarled as he sprinted for the closest vat,
                pulling down on a great lever next to the door. He dodged
                out of the way of a blast of steam. As the door opened, it
                spilled a huge mass to the ground in a fountain of viscous
                green fluid. Out of it rose an enormous two-headed boar,
                bellowing as it clawed the ground.
            </p>
            <img src="maps/Sarshan's tower.png" title="Sarshan's tower" class="left"/>
            <p>
                His followers defeated and backed into a corner, Modra attempted to slip 
                into a secret passage but Lechonero shot him down before he could escape.
                Driven to discover Sarshan's plans for the massive troop movements, our 
                heroes follow the secret passage into the tower.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our heroes exited the secret passage into an apparently library within the tower.
                Dim light filled the area from globes of gray glass set around
                the room. Shelves of books and scrolls line the walls there,
                and a large table covered with scrolls and bound volumes
                dominated an adjoining chamber. A female shadar-kai
                stood there, looking up in astonishment. Two shadar-kai
                warriors, katars at their belts, scrambled away from the door
                in surprise. A third warrior is digging through books on a
                nearby shelf, his greatsword leaning against the wall a few
                feet away.             
            </p>
            <p>
                After dispatching Sarshan's guards, the party explored deeper into the tower 
                and heard growling voices punctuated by yipping snarls beyond a door. 
                Inside were a pair of adjoining rooms that appeared to be well-appointed
                guest chambers. Unfortunately, the occupants seemed
                ill-suited to their comforts. Four gnolls <span class="future">emissaries from the Wicked Fang tribe</span> 
                were there, and a reek of dog filled the air and the blankets on the beds had been pulled off
                and piled in the corners.
                The closest two snarled as they lunged at the party with spear and
                claw, and the others fired their longbows as they took
                cover behind a couch.
            </p>
            <img src="pcs/Barases.png" title="Barases" class="right"/>
            <p>
                After slaying the gnolls and further exploring the tower, the party discovered two captives held prisoner in cells not much 
                less comfortably furnished than the guest rooms for the gnolls:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A young human who identified himself as Barases and claimed to be a traveler
                    in search of his lost brother Petraynus who wandered into Umbraforge as part of his investigation and was imprisoned by Sarshan for trespassing.
                    <span class="future">While some of his claims were true, Barases eventually revealed himself to be a Satyr in disguise, and 
                    while Sarshan did imprison him during his search for Petraynus, he was actually kidnapped from the Feydark when he stumbled across 
                    some of Sarshan's mercenaries.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A hulking Goliath by the name of Camulos.
                    Camulos' story was somewhat more direct: a mercenary who took work with Sarshan's armies, he 
                    took objection to some of Sarshan's more amoral practices and was imprisoned for his interference. Freed from their
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Freed from their cells the prisoners joined our heroes. While continuing their search of the tower, the party started to notice 
                tremors occasionally shaking the tower. While attempting to get high on the visage of the strange trees in the 2nd floor tower garden 
                Karrion discovered the psychic levitation lift passing up through the center of the tower. As the party floated upstairs,
                dim light from globes of gray glass casts faint shadows
                throughout the dark garden. Though the trees and other
                foliage there appeared healthy and luxurious, the leaves,
                stems, and flowers of the plants were sickly shades of dark
                blue, gray, and black. Along the south wall of the chamber
                stood a stone arch identical to the teleportation portals
                the party used to reach Umbraforge. As Festivus attempted 
                to inspect the portal - finding it locked - a hissing sound 
                preceded a cloud of insects suddenly boiling
                up from the shadows, swarming to attack. At the same
                time, what appeared to be a mass of mottled leaves rose
                up to reveal itself as an enormous beetle with viscous
                black fluid dripping from its joints as it lurches toward them.
            </p>
            <img src="pcs/Ringo.png" title="Ringo" class="left"/>
            <p>
                The party dispatched the swarm of insects and Lechonero, Barases, and Karrion put their animal handling skills to the test and tamed the 
                Shadow Beetle. Lechonero kept the beetle as a pet and named him Ringo. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking the lift to the top of the tower, our heroes surprised a squad of Sarshan's personal guard at practice which raised a general alarm.
                Waves of shadar-kai guards streamed in from the main hall below and our heroes, nearly overwhelmed, were forced to retreat to a dead end at the top of the tower - 
                Sarshan's personal quarters. Festivus bought the party some time by dismissing her floating disc - covered in hundreds of pounds of looted, sharp weapons - at the 
                top of the tower shaft, burying a group of guard ascending the lift. In their few spare moments the group frantically searchesd the room for escape or ideas. 
                Escape was not fortcoming, but they did discover some of Sarshan's notes among his possessions. <span class="future">Chief among these notes were obscure references to a 
                place of lost riches - obscure references to the Karak Mines that ultimately help Bram Ironfell determine the location of the lost mines.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually the shadar-kai were too numerous to resist, led by their grizzled captain Thannu, who had ritual scars standing out on his cheeks. 
                Two umbral panthers moved at his side with teeth bared as they hissed. Despite the overwhelming numbers, our heroes were dug in hard at the top of the tower, 
                leading Thannu to yell:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Stand down! Or your lives are forfeit!"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Suddenly, the garden was illuminated by a pulse of white
                light. The archway to the south flared as it revealed the black
                shrine under the Happy Beggar, and a familiar figure stepped from that chamber to
                this. It was the veteran our heroes spoke to in the Happy Beggar, but
                he was no longer stooped with the appearance of age and his
                scarred skin turned gray before their eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The guards around the party saluted the shadar-kai, who
                didn't hide his surprise at seeing them. He took in the
                scene before him with a cold eye. 
            </p>            
            <img src="npcs/Sarshan.png" title="Sarshan" class="right"/>
            <blockquote>
                "I am Sarshan. I assume
                someone has an explanation for this?"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Thannu delivered a quick, military-style report to Sarshan concerning the party's incursion into the tower, along with the number of dead and wounded.
                Even as the captain finished, a warrior entered at a run,
                calling to his master. As he approached to whisper in
                Sarshan's ear, the shadar-kai turned to the party with a look of
                wonder.
            </p>            
            <blockquote>
                "You are, quite literally, the last people I ever expected to
                see here. The charges leveled by my captain warrant torture
                and death. However, I am told that an episode of sabotage
                in my foundry appears to have been thwarted, and that the
                traitorous Modra has been executed by persons unknown.
                What might you know of this?"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                After taking credit for dispatching Modra, Sarshan nodded thoughtfully.
            </p>            
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "As far as you've managed to infiltrate my operations, I can
                    only assume you know a little of who I am. My wealth and
                    reputation turn largely on honor, obligation, and secrecy.
                    When I spoke to you of Modra, I hoped you would kill him
                    and save me the risk of more exposure than he had already
                    caused. The fact that you journeyed here to do the job is
                    a surprise, but for your part in ending his threat to me
                    and whatever he meant to do in the foundry, I am in your
                    debt. However, for your role in the death of my personal
                    guards, you are more greatly in mine. Here is a bargain that

                    of us, but only a precious
                    few have honesty enough
                    to admit it. Whether we
                    sell ourselves for coin,
                    for honor, or ideals, we
                    all have a price whose
                    continued payment
                    leads us inevitably to our
                    end. But when that end
                    comes, will you admit
                    to your balance sheet?
                    Or will you lie when you
                    claim that the blood on
                    your hands was spilled
                    for just cause, not simply
                    your hunger for glory?
                </p>

                    Your skill at arms is clearly first rate. I offer you a place
                    to use and advance that skill. Moreover, I offer you a place
                    where you might live long enough to enjoy the fruits of your
                    bravery. In a month, or six, or a year, your world will be a
                    place you will not want to live. Join me here instead...

                    Though I am nicely positioned to take advantage of these
                    things, I know relatively little yet. What I do know, I cannot
                    share for professional reasons, but trust me when I say that
                    you do not want to know. Name your choice, friends."

            <p>
                With few options, our heroes reluctantly accepted Sarshan's offer.
                At that moment they felt a familiar shaking beneath their feet as another
                tremor rose and fell quickly.
                Then suddenly, an ear-splitting explosion shook
                the tower. Near the eastern side of the chamber, one of
                Sarshan's guards shouted out:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "My lord! The foundry is in flames!" 
            </blockquote> 
            <p>
                The guards sprang into motion, Sarshan all but
                ignoring our heroes as he barked orders. One group was sent to the
                foundry, and another received orders to keep the mercenary
                camps under control. Sarshan took a last squad of
                chainfighters with him as he moved for the lift. Thannu and
                his panthers were the only ones left with the party.
                Bitterness at the men under his command dead at our heroes hands 
                he confronted them before attacking:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "If I was as cruel as my reputation implies, I would
                send you back to watch your world die. Be
                thankful that I am merciful."                
            </blockquote> 
            <p>
                Drained by their earlier battles, our heroes barely survived the encounter with Thannu. 
                From the south windows, Camulos describes the chaos in the
                camps as mercenary bands try to pull back from the
                destruction. The pens of the slave bazaar were
                broken open, and the slaves had overthrown their
                masters and started fleeing to the north.
                Peering out the eastern windows Lechonero warned that
                the foundry was being consumed by ongoing explosions
                of shadow and flame. Thanks to Modra's sabotage the foundry's systems have failed, releasing the
                arcane energy that fuels Sarshan's dark experiments and threatening to destroy the tower.
                Unable to escape through the heavily guarded front doors, Festivus frantically raced against 
                time to unlock Sarshan's private portal in the tower gardens. Just before the foundry explosions 
                consumed the tower and collapsed the portal, she managed to open the way and our heroes tumbled through back to the world and Overlook.
            </p>
            <p>
                The noise of the explosion was heard in the Happy
                Beggar, with Prashant and Ausma discovering the
                secret cellar and the route the party took into the caverns
                below. They arrived just as the our heroes are cleaning
                up and were astounded to discover what lies beneath
                their establishment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The paladins took care of contacting the Overlook
                authorities. While they waited for the city guard to
                arrive, our heroes confirmed that the Shadowfell gate
                has been permanently destroyed. Sarshan's route
                into Overlook had been shut down for good.
                With their religious background, Ausma and
                Prashant recognized the area as a place
                of ancient demon worship. They concluded that the
                dark power that created the specters had festered
                within both sides of the Shadowfell archway all this
                time - a potentially grave danger to Overlook that our
                heroes had eliminated. The teleportation portal was still
                operational, but it could be shut down by representatives
                of the Council.
            </p>
            <p>
                The discovery and destruction of the Shadowfell
                gate makes the party heroes in Overlook, especially
                when Sarshan's connection to the recent orc raid
                was revealed. The shadar-kai's warehouses were
                raided, but in the aftermath of Modra's treachery,
                Sarshan had been careful to clean up any evidence
                of his recent activities. Though his operations are
                shut down for good, no further information on the
                shadar-kai's presence in Overlook could be found.

            <h2>The Lost Mines of Karak</h2>
            <p>
                Previously our heroes thwarted the dark creeper Modra and hamstrung his boss Sarshan's blackmarket arms and mercenary business in Overlook. Sarshan spoke vaguely of a 
                looming threat to the world and possibly Overlook in particular and our heroes turned over what evidence and information they had gathered from their journey to Sarshan's 
                lair in the Shadowfell. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of saving the city not once but twice, the
                party have become well known in Overlook. This
                notoriety saw them approached by Kalad, the dwarf
                paladin they rescued from the Monastery of the Sundered Chain. In
                the aftermath of the thwarted orc raid, Kalad has taken
                up a position as a sergeant in the Overlook watch. It
                is official business that brought him to our heroes that day, where
                he asked them to meet with a member of the Elsir Consortium. 
                Later that day, Kalad escorted them
                to a private room in an upscale Elftown tavern. There,
                he introduced them to a well-dressed dwarf wearing
                the rich robes of a successful merchant, his golden
                beard braided with silver bands.

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "Greetings, Heroes of Overlook. I am Bram Ironfell of the
                    Clan Ironfell and representative of the Elsir Consortium.
                    Your reputations precede you, and for your actions, you
                    have my personal thanks in addition to that of the city. I
                    have a tale I wish to share with you, over dinner and drinks
                    of course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city of Overlook stands at the base of the Stonehome
                    Mountains at the farthest western reaches of
                    the Elsir Vale. This age-old redoubt was the center of
                    the ancient dwarf-kingdom that once dominated the
                    vale, but which faded into obscurity generations ago.
                    Though little is remembered of this lost kingdom,
                    its folk ventured far and wide in their day. One dwarf
                    clan - the Ironfell - made forays in search of mineral
                    wealth in the deserts beyond the Thornwaste to the
                    southwest of Elsir Vale. There, they established a
                    mine they called the Karak Lode, after the first dwarf
                    of Clan Ironfell to fall in its defense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over long years, Karak became a legendary source
                    of wealth as its folk pulled rich deposits of gold, silver,
                    and other precious metals from beneath the desert
                    sands. A supply depot was established at the desert's
                    edge to service the caravans traveling between the
                    mine and Elsir Vale, but the location of the Karak
                    Lode was kept a closely guarded secret. Only oathsworn
                    members of Clan Ironfell ever made the final
                    leg of the journey across the sands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dwarves hold their secrets close, and their grip
                    is doubly tight where wealth is concerned. So it was
                    that Karak's secrecy eventually became its downfall.
                    Under the pressure of monstrous marauders, famine,
                    and migrant human tribes, the dwarf kingdom of
                    Elsir Vale declined. As its resources were taxed past
                    the breaking point, the kingdom's borders began to
                    contract until little more than the territory immediately
                    surrounding Overlook was left. In time,
                    sandstorms struck the southern wastes and the Karak
                    supply depot was abandoned. Soon, all contact with
                    the mine was lost, and the Karak Lode was consigned
                    to history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The location of the Karak Lode was known to few even
                    within the clan, and it was thought that all who had such
                    knowledge were lost when the mines were reclaimed by
                    the desert. Even within the clan, Karak is all but forgotten.
                    However, recent events might change that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The destruction of Sarshan's operations in Overlook
                    saw the shadar-kai's many warehouses and transit
                    points raided. In one of those raids, the watch uncovered
                    documents connected to Sarshan's operations, including
                    an ancient fragment of parchment I understand we have you to thank for. On it was written a
                    list of landmarks and bearings for a journey, along with
                    the name of Clan Ironfell. I had never seen this parchment
                    before. However, at the watch's request, I undertook a bit
                    of research into my family's archives. If what I discovered
                    there holds true, this parchment holds the directions to the
                    Karak Lode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Discovering what became of my kin would end a sad
                    chapter in Ironfell history, but that is not my primary
                    motive in seeking your aid. If the Karak Lode can be found,
                    its wealth offers the means to shore up the defenses of
                    Overlook and the Elsir Vale. However, it is anyone's guess
                    what manner of creatures might lair there, or what defenses
                    the last of the clan left to guard the mines. This is not a job
                    for the city watch, I fear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a mission for
                    heroes who have shown
                    their mettle in the
                    defense of others.
                    If the evidence you have
                    uncovered is true, the
                    Siege of Bordrin's Watch
                    was but the first sortie
                    in a larger campaign,
                    against which Overlook
                    and Elsir Vale cannot
                    stand for long. I will tell
                    you of the Karak Lode,
                    and of lost wealth with
                    which we might defend
                    our land against the war
                    that is coming."

                Bram offered the pary 1,000 gp (half in gold, half in
                gems) as an upfront payment for undertaking the
                search for the Karak Lode. In addition, the party could
                claim any other treasure they recovered along the way.

            <p>
                Following the directions to the Karak Lode, the
                party first headed south across the Thornwaste that
                stretches between Elsir Vale and the Stonehome
                Mountains.
                South of the Westdeep, the broken ground of the Thornwaste
                stretches before them. Ridges of knife-edged stone spread as
                far as the eye can see, interspersed with heavy growths of
                twisted brambles. Their first investigation of them reveal that
                their thorns are iron-sharp, capable of drawing blood even
                through the thickest clothing. No trail or tracks lead into the
                wasteland ahead.
            </p>
            <img src="maps/Clan Rivals.png" class="right"/>
            <p>
                Deep in the Thornwaste a crossbow appeared over the crest of a large outcropping just beyond a ravine
                ahead, trained on the group. A
                scuffling to the east revealed another dwarf bolter rising
                from behind a hedge of screening brambles.
                Suddenly a gang of dwarves from Clan Hammerfist - a rival to Clan Ironfell - 
                attacked the party. They fell before our heroes' might but did manage to 
                disorient the party. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lost in the Thornwaste, our heroes spied a human male in a tattered black coat
                and leggings slipping through the brush and brambles. A battered, wide-brimmed hat shrouded his face,
                his boots held together with coarse twine. He carried a spear
                in one hand, a leather-bound book in the other.
                This was the ranger Mag Blackthorn, and Lechonero nearly shot him with one of his infamous "warning shots."
                After demanding a duel to satisfy his honor, Mag graciously escorted the party to the settlement of Dunesend 
                as the only civilization near our heroes' route.
            </p>
            <img src="maps/Dunesend.png" title="Dunesend" class="left"/>
            <p>
                After a four-day journey our heroes arrived at the village of Dunesend which marks the frontier of two
                equally desolate lands. To the north lies the forbidding
                Thornwaste, across which only the most experienced -
                or most desperate - explorers tread. To the south,
                endless desert dunes march to the far horizon.
                Dunesend was built on the ruins of the dwarven
                supply depot that once served Clan Ironfell's hidden
                mining operations in the desert. All that remains of
                the original dwarven enclave are scattered foundations
                and a single watchtower. However, the dwarves'
                carefully constructed system of spring-fed wells and
                cisterns still functions, allowing those who dwell here
                to farm the scrubland and eke out an existence in the
                harsh landscape.
                In years past, trade caravans made Dunesend a
                waypoint along an east-west road that ran along the 
                ancient, pre-dwarven, basalt block wall carved in the 
                form of a serpentine creature with a crest running down its back. 
                Today, the road
                is sand and the caravans have all but vanished. The
                handful of families remaining in Dunesend do so
                because they have nowhere else to go.
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/The Warden.png" title="The Warden" class="right"/>
            <p>
                As our heroes approach the edge of the village a rustling in the thorny bracken revealed the
                presence of a creature ahead. Lechonero caught a glimpse of a bearded face, its forehead
                marked with goat's horns. It snarled as it turned and raced
                away to the south, quickly disappearing within the briars.
                They crested a low rise to see the expanse of thorns suddenly
                end, a great sea of sand beyond it. At the transition from the
                Thornwaste to the desert, a decrepit village sprawled, its huts
                and fields spreading to either side of an ancient stone tower.
                A sudden cry of pain drifted toward the party on the wind.
                In the center of the settlement, sun-darkened human villagers
                observed in angry silence as a massive gnoll raised a bloodflecked
                flail over its head. At its feet, a human male lay dead.
                Behind the gnoll coiled a serpentine creature with glittering blue
                scales and dozens of legs. It watched the villagers hungrily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our heroes rushed to the aid of the villages, dispatching the demonic gnoll and his pet behir. 
                As the patrolling satyrs came to the aid of the gnoll, the party's newcomer Barases revealed 
                himself as a satyr to negotiate. After a tense standoff where most of the party briefly turned 
                against Barases, he managed to diffuse the situation and convince the satyrs to stand down. 
                The satyrs informed our heroes:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "That creature was the Warden, like us, he served 
                Shephatiah, Queen of the Drylands. The blue worm was his steed
                and enforcer.
                The Warden was here to make his monthly collection
                of tribute."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Barases offered to pay the tribute in the villager's stead and compensate Shephatiah for the loss 
                of her servant the Warden. Barases asked permission to pay homage to the queen in person and the satyrs 
                said they would ask her leave and return with the answer in a few days.
            </p>
            <p>
                The villagers were noticeably cool toward our heroes, and when Lechonero maked one faux paux too many the 
                group exiled him from Dunesend while they tried to talk to the townsfolk.  On his own, Lechonero stumbled upon 
                the ruins of the ancient dwarven cistern the village was built on - providing an explanation for the giant 
                shield wall separating the tiny hamlet from the vast desert.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally an elderly villager named Darkus Comahni moved to claim the 
                body left by the Warden and in his grief consented to talk with our heroes:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "The queen's wrath will surely come down on us. Where will you outsiders be then, I wonder?...
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Warden was a foul tyrant that serves
                    the Queen of the Drylands. The blue worm has slain several among us in recent
                    months. The others were creatures of the Thornwaste in
                    league with the Warden. They are the ones that prevent us
                    from fleeing this place or seeking aid for our plight.
                    Poor weather has delayed our crops, but the Warden 
                    accused us of holding out. He used poor Vaudnim to set an
                    example for us all...
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Warden first appeared from the desert a year ago,
                    stating that Queen Shephatiah had come to reclaim her
                    ancient throne. The name meant nothing to us, but the
                    Warden slew several of our strongest when we stood against
                    him. Now he orders us to pay tribute in goods and food or
                    his blue worm will devour us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The satyrs live within the Thornwaste along the desert
                    frontier. Like the shifter brigands of the desert, they have
                    eagerly pledged themselves to the Warden's service. The
                    Warden comes always from the desert to the south. Where
                    his queen is, we do not know, but he and his followers
                    carry no more than a few days' water to get here. A few
                    of our folk tried to follow the Warden's trail when he first
                    appeared, but they never returned. All I can tell you is that
                    the Warden came once with a shifter who spoke out loud
                    of returning to somewhere called Karak. This creature was
                    soundly beaten by the Warden for his slip."
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                With the mention of Karak, our heroes decide to follow the satyrs directly 
                rather than wait for their return. Setting out from Dunesend, the group made their way
                into the desert. Though the arid sands are inhospitable,
                their hard-packed dunes made for easier going
                than the Thornwaste.
            </p>

            <p>
                As they traveled, the intermittent desert landmarks they
                passed were a perfect match for the course set out by Bram Ironfell's
                directions. They were a scattered series of basalt pillars, the
                remnants of long-ago volcanic eruptions rising now like
                sentinels from the sand.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Desert Patrol.png" title="Desert Patrol" class="right"/>
            <p>
                On the second day of travel, a figure emerged from a haze of wind-blown
                sand. The emaciated form of an elderly human female
                crawled toward our heroes on hands and knees, her face lined and
                sunburned beneath the hood of a ragged cloak. Her voice
                raised against the wind, she called out: 
            <blockquote>
                "Turn back! Nothing
                but death awaits you in the heart of the desert!"
            </blockquote>
            <p>                
                Before they reached the woman to assist, our heroes spotted a cloaked form lying on the ground a short distance
                behind the old woman, all but invisible beneath a thin layer of sand. With their ambush foiled, 
                several bestial humanoids rose suddenly from the ground, the
                layer of sand that concealed them streaming down their mottled
                brown cloaks. They wielded razor-sharp short swords, snarling
                as they attacked.
                At the same time the old woman's form shimmered like heat haze. In her place
                stood a wizened hag, pointed teeth bared in a hideous
                smile as she laughed.

            <p>                
                The day after defeating the patrol sent out by Queen Shephatiah, early that morning, the course they had been following
                became a rocky track leading toward another basalt bluff
                in the distance. However, as the track curved around to its
                south side, they saw two guard towers of hewn stone set into
                the face of the bluff. The narrow gouges of arrow
                slits flanked a narrow track leading directly into the rock.
                Though worn by long years of sand and wind, the towers
                were clearly of dwarven construction, standing as strong as
                the day they were built.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fortress guarding the Karak Lode consists of two
                levels within the basalt bluff, plus a lower level that
                hides the secret entrance to the mines.
                The basalt bluff is 50 feet high, and from its top,
                there is a view of the desert for several miles in every
                direction. Fireplaces and braziers within the complex
                are vented to chimneys that route through narrow
                cracks and crevices, formerly making entry from above impossible 
                while the fortress is inhabited. However, in the long years since the mine was
                lost, a collapse on the bluff above had created an
                entrance into the courtyard.
            </p>
            <p>
                The darkened entry corridor extended inward between rows
                of arrow slits. At the far end, a massive stone gate banded
                with iron stood closed. Halfway along the corridor, a
                rusty portcullis blocked further movement. The sand that
                had drifted in to cover the corridor floor was well marked by
                recent footprints and signs of heavy objects being dragged.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dark figures loomed on the other side of the closest
                arrow slits, silently watching our heroes and giving off a foul odor.
                On closer inspection, the unmoving figures were crudely
                made straw dummies, old dwarven helms on their heads and
                ancient polearms lashed to them with rope. Sneaking past the dummies 
                our heroes stumbled upon the troglodyte guards that had set up the stand-ins while they relaxed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having finished off the troglodytes, our heroes also dispatched several 
                off-duty shifter guards, one lounging around the dungeon stairs, some in their bunks - 
                and one Karrion shot on the shitter.
            </p>
            <p>
                From there our heroes explored the abandoned upper floors of the fortress, before descending 
                the rear stairs into the Great Hall. The heavy scent of decay was sharp there and the hall
                was filled with Sussur trees - strange trees of the Feydark with
                silver-gray bark and gnarled branches that rose almost to the
                ceiling, their thick roots punching down into the stone of the
                floor. 
                Atop a 2 foot high dais to the north, the eladrin Queen Shephatiah sat upon
                an ornate marble throne carved with bas-reliefs of dwarf miners at work. 
                Five human brigands and a shifter warrior stood arrayed about her.
                The decomposing corpse of a villager from Dunesend lay at the queen's feet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Barases, knowledgeable about fey glamours and nobility, saw through 
                the illusion upon "Shephatiah" and guessed her to be a dark dryad in a 
                magical disguise rather than a true eladrin noble. 
                As if a veil had been lifted, he saw through the corporeal
                disguise of the eladrin queen, revealing the foul humanoid
                plant creature beneath, her feet turning to roots digging deep into the body of the villager.
                Exposed, the imposter and her guards immediately attacked, joined by giant Cacklefiend Hyenas
                from the next room.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having defeated the false queen and her minions, our heroes exited through the courtyard. 
                The ceiling of this huge pillared chamber had collapsed, a
                great pile of sand collecting near the east wall. Three sets of
                doors exit this area, arrow slits lining the walls high above.
                Suddenly a massive carrion crawler erupted from the pile of sand 
                and a flight of harpies descended from the hole in the ceiling.
            </p>
            <p>
                A desperate struggle ensued as our heroes tried to shut the doors on the carrion crawler while it 
                paralyzed them and the harpies magically charmed them to walk into the crawler's 
                maws. Half the group retreated to the upper levels to fire arrows down into the courtyard through 
                the arrow slits while Melvin kept leaping off the pillars to pluck the harpies out of the air. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Having cleared the fortress, our heroes proceeded to the lower level. Bypassing an animated steel 
                cobra guardian and dispatching a lesser berbalang haunting the Ironfell crypts, our heroes discover the dungeons. 
                The ancient dungeon showed signs of recent use, with scuff
                marks along the floor indicating traffic in both directions.
                Four large cells stood in the center of the chamber, the
                entrance of each blocked by a lowered portcullis controlled
                by a nearby winch and pulley. From the darkness
                came a bright chirping sound.
            </p>
            <p>
                The southwest cell was occupied by an aged human
                male, his lined face sporting a snow-white beard to
                match his fringe of hair. He wore the garb of a simple
                desert peasant, and appeared to have not been there
                long. Seven yellow canaries perched on his shoulders
                and hopped around his cell. The Birdman whistled and
                chirped at his tiny charges. When spoken to, he simply nodded
                and smiled.
            </p>
            <p>
                The prisoner offered no resistance and allowed himself
                to be led upstairs where our heroes secured a room to rest for the night. 
                He accepted food and water, smiling when spoken to but otherwise ignoring
                the party as they went to sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several hours later our heroes were awakened by the rattling of a portcullis
                being raised, only to find the bird man gone. Searching the 
                fortress they discover that the path they followed to the fortress around the bluff was gone, swallowed
                by a raging sandstorm. They are forced to take shelter in the empty fortress, but before retreating Lechonero noticed 
                something on the sand-strewn floor past the portcullis:
                Humanoid tracks had been laid down by bare feet, a telltale
                yellow feather trodden beneath them. The Birdman appeared
                to have left the fortress, setting out into the deadly storm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just as our heroes were about to go back to sleep, the silence was shattered by a frantic chirping. The
                Birdman's canaries were nowhere to be seen, yet their shrill
                warning echoed from the stones.
                Thanks to the warning, our heroes spotted sudden movement at the arrow slits along the south
                wall. Three gray-skinned creatures with long, spindly arms
                were squeezing through the narrow gaps and a hulking troglodyte with a skull mask and staff bursts through
                the east door, another gray-skinned choker behind him.
            </p>
            <p>
                After defeating the would-be ambushers our heroes immediately sought out where they came from. They assumed 
                the fortress was completely cleared and the with storm preventing anyone from arriving from outside they reasoned 
                the attack must have come from inside the fortress. A thorough search of the fortress led our heroes back to the 
                dungeons. The solid floor of the southeast cell newly contained a perfectly
                round hole at the head of a smooth-walled shaft leading
                straight down. Below the floor, an aging pulley system
                descended into darkness. The pulley raised and lowered an
                8-foot-wide wooden lift platform that sat then a few feet
                below the hole. The battered platform was emblazoned with
                the faded crest of Clan Ironfell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the lift our heroes enter the Karak Mines proper and dispatch more troglodyte guards.
                Once inside actual mineshafts they see that within the damp gray stone of the cavern walls, a faint
                light pulsed. On close examination, they saw veins of dark red
                twisting through the stone of the walls and ceiling, glowing
                with a dull light. Drawing on her Dungeoneering knowledge Karrion identified that this phenomenon 
                wasn't a known Underdark substance and Kitara used her arcane knowledge to identify it as raw elemental 
                energy that had somehow leached into the natural world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recent tracks along the main passageway led our heroes on.
                The central caverns they passed through showed signs of recent
                mining activity, though on a much smaller scale than the
                dwarves' operations of old.
            </p>
            <p>
                While following the tracks, a vast gallery opened up where the dwarves of Ironfell
                once worked, their long-rotted bodies now scattered across the cavern. 
                The rickety remains of ancient ladders and carts
                were spread across the cavern. One prominent vein of the
                strange, red-glowing stone crossed the chamber's floor and
                climbed its walls, its cold light pulsing brightly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here and there, dwarf skeletons were strewn across the rocky
                ground, rusted weapons lying nearby. The dwarves of Karak
                appeared to have slain each other in the end. Oddly, however,
                many of the skeletons appeared to be missing their skulls.
            </p>
            <p>
                A small horde of enemies prowled the cavern - a barlgura, 
                several Bloodweb Spider swarms, a Chillborn Zombie, and two more Carrion Crawlers.
                Using her invisibility, Kitara snuck into the cavern and repetitively 
                drew off individuals to be slaughtered by the party waiting in side passages.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final cavern in the mines was circular, showing signs of excavation on
                its far side. However, the way ahead was blocked by a wide
                crevice that pulsed with a lurid red glow - a rift to the Elemental Chaos. In the shadow of
                that light stood two red-skinned demons, slashing the air
                with three-clawed hands. Behind them were piled hundreds
                of dwarven skulls, a gruesome bier on which coiled a
                serpentine creature with a humanlike face: the real Queen Shephatiah - a Guardian Naga.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a bitter battle with Shephatiah, her Mezzodemon guards, and a fire elemental 
                summoned through the rift our heroes emerged triumphant. 
                Searching the chamber revealed
                a set of scrolls holding parchment correspondence
                written and transported by the naga's mezzodemon
                lieutenants. The missives were in Deep Speech, 
                and detail how Shephatiah discovered
                the portal leading to the Karak Lode on a sojourn
                within the Elemental Chaos. They also made reference
                to the reopening of the mines being financed by
                a group that the scrolls did not name. These unknown
                masters had claimed the wealth of the Karak Lode for
                themselves, and were having that wealth shipped to them
                by way of the elemental rift. While the parchments
                indicated that this group intended to ramp up production
                in the mines in response to an increasing need for ore,
                the cryptic notes indicated that Shephatiah herself did
                not know the identity of those she worked for.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a long trek back to Overlook, our heroes relayed
                their findings to Bram Ironfell. The dwarf was disheartened
                by the news, and he told them that he would
                leave the mines closed in order to prevent others from
                suffering the fate of his clanfolk who perished there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Festivus entered into a torrid affair with Bram Ironfell following 
                our heroes' return to Overlook, but it was only a few months before 
                the business of the Elsir Consortium called Bram away from the city.
                <span class="future">Festivus has had no word from Bram in the months since.</span>

            <h2>Den of the Destroyer</h2>
            <p>
                While recuperating from their trip to the Karak Mines, 
                The day was dreary, the sky threatening rain. Suddenly a voice
                called out, and they turned to see a familiar face: Kalad 
                <span class="future">from the Siege of Bordrin's Watch</span>.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Word on the street is that someone's looking for you. A
                messenger from Brindol. She was in the market, asking
                everyone in earshot if they knew you. She said her name
                was Alys, sounded desperate."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                When they went looking for Alys, they found that she had gone missing:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Alys you say? That girl from Brindol, said she was looking for
                them that put down the orc raid? She passed this way an hour ago,
                but I saw her go off with some of them Lost Ones. They seemed a
                little too happy to see her, if you know what I mean."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The underworld guild the Lost Ones had kidnapped Alys. Assuming her to 
                be a compatriot of our heroes they intended to pump her for information to 
                help the Lost Ones bring them down in revenge for their prior defeats 
                <span class="future">and to collect a bounty set on our heroes' heads by Sarshan</span>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While tracking the Lost Ones back to their lair in an abandoned temple of Pelor in Nine Bells, 
                our heroes came across a heavily armed elf sitting casually on
                the slanted eaves above the door of a nearby building. The
                elf wore a patch across one eye, appraising our heroes carefully
                with the other.
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Gilgathorn.png" class="left"/>
            <blockquote>
                "I'd be careful if I were you. The Lost Ones aren't going to be gentle
                when you find them. They've got reason enough to kill you,
                even if you didn't have a bounty on your head. The name is Gilgathorn, 
                Thorn to my friends. 
                I'm a mercenary by trade."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                After flirting with Kitara,
                Gilgathorn confirmed that the Lost Ones were behind Alys' kidnapping, 
                that they sought revenge on our heroes, and that an unknown individual 
                had set a 1,000 gp bounty on our heroes' heads. <span class="future">In truth, 
                Gilgathorn Was a bounty hunter trying to cash in on the bounty himself. He had 
                figured out that Sarshan was the one posting the reward and that the party is 
                dangerous enough to require preparation. He was hoping the Lost Ones would 
                weaken our heroes enough that he could take them - and be on hand to assist our 
                heroes if necessary to prevent the Lost Ones from getting the bounty.</span>

            <img src="places/Abandoned Temple of Pelor.png" class="right"/>
            <img src="tactical/Abandoned Temple of Pelor.png" class="right"/>
            <img src="npcs/Alys.png" class="right"/>
            <p>
                Parting ways with Gilgathorn our heroes entered Nine Bells, the rain that has been threatening
                all day beginning to fall. By the time they located the temple
                of Pelor, the streets were all but empty, the inhabitants of
                the district fled to shelter. From the outside, the temple
                entrance was set above a short flight of stone stairs. The flare
                of lightning shows where relief carvings once adorned the
                temple's outer walls, but these were unrecognizable after
                years of neglect and abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the temple, water covered the cracked marble floor where broken
                freestanding frescoes blocked four doors in the far wall.
                Rain poured down through a square opening in the ceiling,
                shards of stained glass clinging to its edges. Beneath it, a
                young woman in tattered traveling garb had been gagged,
                blindfolded, bound to a wooden chair, and apparently alone. 
                However, well-gnawed bones spread across the room and
                the reek of wet fur showed the presence of dogs somewhere
                within the temple. And a flash of lightning through the open ceiling
                revealed faint movement behind the frescoes, figures
                lurking there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our heroes turned the Lost Ones' ambush into an ambush of their own,
                dispatched the Lost Ones in the temple with overwhelming force 
                and rescued Alys. She was beaten but recovers quickly, determined to show her 
                strength. She spoke with the measured countenance of someone
                reciting a memorized message:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Greetings from Richard D'Eversholt,
                castellan of the Hall of Great Valor. I beseech you to return
                to Brindol with all haste, as your presence is needed here.
                The matter concerns one of the relics that we recovered
                while saving our town's captives in Rivenroar, and is most urgent."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The journey from Overlook to Brindol was relatively
                uneventful. However, as our heroes' approached the point
                where the Dwarf Road meets the Old North Road at
                the foot of Lake Restin, they encountered a band of
                soldiers on patrol. They were stopped for questioning,
                but their names were quickly recognized.
            </p>
            <p>
                The leader of the patrol identified himself as
                Zoram Splintershield, a dwarf whose folk dwell in the
                foothills of the Giant's Shield. He and his troop were
                patrolling the roads around the lake and the Blackfens.
                Zoram told our heroes that in the past few weeks,
                there had been a number of unprovoked attacks and
                abductions in the north of Elsir Vale. Though patrols
                like his scoured the roads in search of these bandits,
                they have so far come up empty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, Zoram informs our heroes that the abductions
                seem to be perpetrated by gnolls, who have
                traditionally stayed well clear of the vale. Our heroes report seeing
                no sign of gnolls during their time on the road. 
                As such, Zoram bid them a safe journey
                to Brindol, but warned them to keep a wary eye out for
                any trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
                The journey to Brindol took a little over a week.
                Arriving late at night, our heroes found the Hall of Valor
                closed up tight, Alys told them that Richard
                likely had already gone to bed at his home outside
                of town. However, the party's arrival was noted by Mirtala's 
                niece. She invited them to dinner and offered
                comfortable lodging. While speaking with Mirtala she said:
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Mirtala.png" class="left"/>
            <blockquote>
                Things have been quiet in Brindol since that awful
                business, all thanks to your brave efforts, again and always.
                Still, there's families packing up and taking to the road,
                more and more each week. There's talk of gnolls attacking
                settlements in the north, and word of the orcs rising up in
                the Stonehome. Dark days are coming, or so it seems.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The next morning, our heroes made their way to the
                Hall of Great Valor to meet Richard.
                The Hall of Great Valor was as they last saw it, its glass
                cases lining the walls with relics of Elsir Vale's past. Three
                freestanding displays showed off artifacts of the vanquished
                Red Hand of Doom, a large map of the surrounding lands
                updated with details of the Hand's most recent forays
                against Elsir Vale and its people.
            </p>
            <p>
                A heavily pregnant Jalissa stood dusting relics in a display case across the room,
                and upon seeing our heroes called into the back room. Richard D'Eversholt stepped out to great 
                them, smoothing out his stained smock as he bowed: 
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Jalissa.png" class="left"/>
            <img src="pcs/Richard D'Eversholt.png" class="right"/>
            <img src="tactical/The Hall of Great Valor.png" class="left"/>
            <blockquote>
                "My friends. Welcome back to Brindol. Thank you for your 
                quick arrival."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Though friendly and showing several extra pounds of contented family life, 
                Richard D'Eversholt was obviously uneasy. Only after locking the doors of the hall did 
                he tell the party why he has summoned them there:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "You recall the platinum blade that was one of the treasures
                taken by Sinruth and his hobgoblin horde. Upon its return
                to the hall, it seemed none the worse for its ordeal. It is a relic
                of some worth and sentimental value, but holds no magic
                that I or any of my predecessors here have noted. But then a
                week ago, while working late at night, I heard a voice, calling
                me. From its case, the sword spoke to me, beseeching me to
                summon heroes to its aid. It asked for all of you by name."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Richard D'Eversholt explained that after the sword began speaking,
                he removed it from its display case and hid it
                in the hall's back room. He led our heroes to a cluttered
                workspace, where the platinum longsword
                lay beneath a cloth on a table. When the cloth was
                removed, without warning, the small workroom is filled with
                a woman's voice, weak: 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "You have come, my heroes,
                    but my thanks must be brief. I am Amyria, and I have
                    summoned you here from great need. I know it must seem
                    strange to hear me speak, but I assure you that this form
                    is only temporary. It is for that reason that I beseech you
                    for your aid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Decades ago, a race of monastics born of the Elemental
                    Chaos established a fortress in Elsir Vale. These were the
                    githzerai,
                    who lived secretly in their remote outpost before
                    suddenly vanishing. Their Fortress of Graystone was well
                    hidden, and remained uninhabited for long years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some months ago, Fortress Graystone was invaded and
                    claimed by a pack of gnoll mercenaries calling themselves
                    the Wicked Fang. Their leader, a sadistic follower of the
                    demon lord Yeenoghu, has begun to send his raiders out
                    into Elsir Vale and beyond. In recent weeks, this gnoll
                    chieftain Fangren has managed to open a conduit of
                    power to Yeenoghu's realm in the Elemental Chaos. He
                    plans to claim some small fragment of the demon lord's
                    power, transforming himself into an exarch of the Beast of
                    Butchery. It was the creation of this conduit that awoke me
                    from my age-long slumber.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Fangren completes his ritual, demonic forces
                    will have gained a foothold in the mortal realm. More
                    importantly, that conduit to the Elemental Chaos can be
                    manipulated through a ritual that I will provide to you.
                    This is the boon that I pray you grant me. Bring me to
                    Fortress Graystone and free me from this prison.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ritual will free me from my current form, restoring
                    me to my rightful body. I can say no more than that.
                    Though I am granted the power to speak to you, my
                    memory has been fractured by long years of sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In opening the conduit to the
                    Elemental Chaos, Fangren unwittingly set the stage
                    for my restoration. The ritual will alter the conduit
                    such that it can channel energy from other planes to
                    fuel my transformation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Wicked Fang tribe
                    is not to be underestimated. They are strong and
                    steeped in demon worship. While making your way
                    to the fortress will almost certainly be dangerous, the
                    threat to Elsir Vale and the wider world is great.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fortress is built into the side of a peak
                    of the Giant's Shield. No roads or trails travel to the
                    fortress, so the journey will be arduous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alas, I cannot tell you more. When the rift was opened, Fangren's
                    thoughts and plans came to me as in a dream that
                    woke my own mind. I have not seen him since, and
                    my spirit grows weaker with every hour that passes.
                    Before long, I fear that my voice and thought will be
                    lost once more.

                A sudden crash from the hall outside was punctuated by an
                explosion of fire. A burning bottle had been lobbed through
                one of the hall's windows, shattering to spread flaming liquid
                across tables and display cases. A moment later, the locked
                front door was kicked open, a squad of armed figures bursting in.

                Quick thinking and reflexes - along with the unexpected assistance of 
                Gilgathorn - led our heroes to defeat the attackers 
                and extinguish the flames before any more damage could be done to the 
                Hall.

                Gilgathorn was shadowing our heroes and eavesdropped on their talk with 
                Amyria. Coincidentally Gilgathorn knew Fortress Graystone and subsequently 
                headed there to set traps to weaken them and ultimately ambush them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The journey to Fortress Graystone was well off the established
                trade roads and trails of Elsir Vale, but our heroes' journey 
                there was relatively uneventful.
                On the last day, thick forest had been giving way to rolling
                foothills. The hills rose to a sudden wall of rocky peaks
                rising high above the trees. A rough gravel path wound its
                way along the base of the mountains, the first sign of a true
                trail seen since the departure from Brindol.

                Fortress Graystone sits built into the side of a low
                peak of the Giantshield Mountains. The structure
                is well hidden from the eyes of the inhabitants of Elsir
                Vale, as was the intention of its builders. 
                <span class="future">The githzerai 
                built Fortress Graystone to protect a thinning
                between the Elemental Chaos and the world.</span>
                A massive stone staircase leading into the side of the 
                mountain is the only entrance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortress Graystone reflected the aesthetic of the githzerai
                who built it, demonstrating balance between the
                chaos of their birthplace and the order they sought to
                impose upon their own lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fortress takes its name from the distinctive
                gray stone found in this area of the Giantshield Mountains,
                colored that way by prevalent veins of platinum ore.
                The stone walls of the fortress are decorated with bas
                reliefs and carvings that have withstood the passage
                of years with little deterioration. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A massive stone staircase rose against the cliff face, 
                narrowing as it reached a set of double stone doors set into
                the rock wall. Four large statues, each depicting a githzerai
                warrior in full combat regalia, stood on pedestals watching
                over the entrance to Fortress Graystone. A small waterfall
                flowed down the side of the mountain, eroding a stone
                balcony set further up the cliff face and leaving the stone
                steps slick and treacherous.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our heroes fought their way up the stairs in a frontal assault, 
                battling gnolls and summoned stone spirits that animated the 
                statues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Past the guards and the stone doors was a wide octagonal chamber. 
                On five of the walls, portals glowed and pulsed with
                arcane energy. The far side of the room appeared to be made
                of extremely thick glass, revealing a second chamber beyond
                with four portals on the wall. A massive circle of carved
                runes dominated the floor of the first chamber, while a
                smaller circle adorned the floor of the room beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
                This turned out to be a disorienting portal room built by the 
                githzerai as a mental exercise. By studying the markings in the 
                room Melvin realized that his master Marduk Goldbludgeon had tough him in the 
                githzerai monastic tradition. Using his mental training he successfully 
                navigated the party through the portals while remaining behind to control 
                them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Past the portals, at the bottom of the second staircase was a crescent-shaped
                chamber set with three doors, its walls and floors stained
                red-black with dried blood. The stench of rot and filth was
                overwhelming, thankfully as it allowed our heroes to sneak up 
                on the gnolls there unaware as they argued among themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our heroes took one look in the adjoining room: 
                The ceiling of the huge chamber rose some 60 feet
                overhead. The sound of rushing water sounded out faintly,
                a meager reflection of its source - a waterfall descending
                from an opening in the ceiling to a pool set within a raised
                platform. Two stone gutters carried water down from the
                pool into channels in the floor, creating small rivers that
                flow through circuitous paths in the ground with great
                speed. Every few seconds, the noise of stone on stone
                sounded out as these aqueducts in the floor shifted to follow
                a new path.
                Promptly our heroes declared it to be a trap and shut the door.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the hall to its end, the foul scent of gnoll assaulted our heroes the moment the door
                was opened. The massive chamber was once decorated with
                bas-reliefs, now crumbled and defaced by the marks of
                weapons. Crude practice dummies scattered across the
                chamber were under attack by a pack of armed gnolls under
                the direction of a shadar-kai.
                The east and west walls of the chamber were lined with
                dark arrow slits. Two trapdoors in the southern part of the
                chamber were open, ladders visible and leading down.
            </p>
            <p>
                Faced with a large force, our heroes enacted a fighting retreat back down 
                the hall and out through the portals, using Melvin's mastery of the portals 
                to divert their enemies and release them in managable chunks. Despite the 
                advantage the shadar-kai and a gnoll warmaster with an especially 
                powerful sword made it a close battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Searching the shadar-kai's possessions, our heroes discovered a note:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Kyrion,
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me make my orders clear: you are there only to
                    train the gnolls, not to fight for them. Watch yourself;
                    they are a bloodthirsty and violent lot, and they
                    may turn on you. You may need to remind them
                    from time to time that I pay them well for their services,
                    and that I can withdraw my support for their
                    butchery at any time. Be careful of their leader, for
                    he is far more cunning than others would give him
                    credit for. I would not have even considered trying to
                    trick them into service with that "Emissary" deception
                    that riled up that fool Sinruth. These gnolls
                    have the power of their foul god on their side. They
                    are not to be trifled with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    — Sarshan

            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The gnoll warmaster carried the sword known as Wicked Fang.
                <span class="future">It was crafted as a gift
                for the gnoll pack of the same name. Sarshan ordered
                his shadar-kai warriors to travel to Overlook and
                kidnap one of the greatest dwarven weaponsmiths in
                the city, bringing him back to the Shadowfell to do
                the arms dealer's bidding. Sarshan commanded the
                weaponsmith to craft Wicked Fang. When the job was
                done, Sarshan ordered the weaponsmith killed and
                his blood used in the ritual that bestowed the sword
                with its magical properties.
                Sarshan sent his lieutenant Kyrion back to the world 
                to train the gnolls in the proper use of shadar-kai weapons.
                The completed sword was given as a gift to Fangren, who in 
                turn gave it to his most trusted warmaster.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Exhausted, our heroes rested the night while Melvin 
                concentrated on holding the portals. They awoke unharmed 
                but Melvin had disappeared.
            </p>
            <p class="future">
                Mentally attuned to the psychic energies of Fortress Graystone, 
                Melvin "heard" a mental plea for help and followed it through the 
                portals and the waterfall room into a meditation chamber the gnolls 
                had jammed shut with the broken haft of a spear. Scrawled across its face
                are warnings written in the Abyssal tongue of the gnolls:
                "DANGER! HAUNTED! STAY OUT!" 
            </p>
            <p class="future">
                The meditation chamber did house the cast-off malignant psychic residue 
                of past petitioners that attacked Melvin, but his training allowed him 
                to overcome them. Once on the meditation platform Melvin established a psychic 
                link to the "voice" - surprisingly his missing master Marduk Goldbludgeon. 
                Melvin's master told him he was holed up with his own githzerai masters - who 
                were pursued by a relentless horde of githyanki. Using the psychic energies of 
                the fortress Marduk attempted to teleport Melvin to him using the githzerai 
                psychic network connecting their fortresses across the Elemental Chaos.
                However, something severed the network mid-transport and Melvin was lost 
                in the vastness of the Elemental Chaos.
            </p>

            <p>
                The rest of the part went in search of Melvin in the only place they had yet to look: 
                Fangren's ritual chamber at the back of the complex. 
                A deep thrumming noise echoed throughout this high-domed
                ritual chamber, the air crackling with energy.
                Three large cauldrons burned furiously along walls that rose
                10 feet to a wide balcony fronted by crimson curtains. An
                altar sat atop a stepped dais in the center of the room, a
                group of hooded gnolls around it and a supine form atop it <span class="future">Bin</span>. 
                A short distance away,
                the air rippled in a shifting haze of energy where a portal
                took form.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Ritual Chamber.png" class="left" />
            <img src="npcs/Fangren.png" class="right" />
            <p>
                Several gnolls mounted on giant slaughterfang hyenas and a pair of crocottas patrolled the circumference.
                Scattered around the chamber were a number of
                hunched humanoid creatures - the helpless captives of
                Elsir Vale, transformed into horrid abyssal wretches. As
                they spotted our heroes, they raised a keening howl, lurching forward
                to attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                A brutal battle followed in which our heroes defeated Fangren's minions and then faced off with 
                the chieftain himself, directing the planar energy of the rift like a weapon - the giant claw of 
                Yeenoghu lashing out at them from the Elemental Chaos. With Fangren defeated our heroes rescued the 
                unconscious female doppelganger <span class="future">Bin</span> from the altar and worked to redirect 
                the planar energies in a new ritual described by Amyria.
            </p>
            <p>
                A vortex of brilliant energy opened up in the air as the
                platinum sword was gently tugged from Festivus' hands. It rose
                to hover in the air before the newly formed conduit, tendrils
                of silver light reaching out to touch it. All were blinded by
                a brilliant flash, then an instant later, the ritual chamber
                fell silent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Standing there was a young human female of
                unearthly beauty and grace. Her silver hair hung down her
                back, a band of chalk-white pigment stretching from one
                temple to the other across her eyes. She was garbed in armor
                made of slender, overlapping plates. In one hand, she held
                a leather-bound tome; in the other, the platinum longsword.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "I am Amyria. Who are you, and why am I here?...
                I remember that I am Amyria, and I
                have lived many lives. I was in the sword. I remember you
                freed me. The ritual you performed transformed the planar
                breach in this place, allowing it to channel the energy of the
                Astral Sea. Energy necessary for my transformation.
                I have been reborn with purpose,
                even if that purpose is yet unclear to me."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Much to her own
                consternation, Amyria was not fully certain why she had
                been brought there. She did not recognize our heroes
                or their names, and had no memory of her words to
                them while her spirit lingered within the sword.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond her minimal recollections, Amyria was a clean
                slate - her transformation a literal rebirth. Though
                she was of an adult mindset, she knew nothing of her
                own past.
            </p>
            <p>
                The leather-bound tome is a ritual book that
                Amyria gave to Festivus with her thanks. It contained
                a modified version of the ritual just performed, allowing
                her to stop the flow of energy that fuels a
                planar portal and safely seal away the danger of Fortress Graystone.

                Bin awoke a short while later. In her unconscious state her true 
                identity was apparent, though immediately upon waking she adopted 
                the disguise of another race using her natural abilities. She admitted 
                to having no memory of her past save the last several months. She awoke 
                with no memory in Nine Bells in Overlook. There she was revived, named 
                ("bin" means "empty cup" in Dwarven), and given purpose by the local priestess Aelys, 
                putting her powers of disguise to work infiltrating  the evil forces working 
                against Elsir Vale. While infiltrating the Wicked Fang tribe she was captured 
                and subjected to Fangren's corrupt rituals manipulating enemies from the 
                Elemental Chaos. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the battle our heroes were weakened and injured - the perfect time 
                for a suckerpunch. Coming upon our weary heroes Gilgathorn revealed his true nature 
                as a bounty hunter intent on collecting Sarshan's price on their heads. He attacked 
                with his minions and figurines of wondrous power (an Ironwood Hound and an Elderwood Falcon), 
                but despite their battle wounds (and with Bin's assistance), our heroes proved victorious.
            </p>
            <p>
                As they exited the fortress,
                Amyria requested that they accompany her to Overlook,
                not back to Brindol, as she believed she has
                business there. With the Wicked Fang dead Bin's mission 
                was complete, and she joined our heroes for the trek 
                back to Overlook.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once back in Overlook Amyria bids our heroes farewell once they reached the
                entrance to the city, slipping away into the crowd.
                Karrion and Kitara surreptiously tailed her to the Temple of Ioun in the Nine Bells district.
                There, she immediately became lost in prayer, lingering apparently indefinitely. The party took 
                shifts watching the deva, but eventually lost track of her in their subsequent adventures.

        	<h2>The Temple Between</h2>
        	<p>
        		The towering walls of Overlook rose slowly but steadily over
        		the horizon as our heroes drew ever nearer their destination. From
        		a distance, the city looked as secure and serene as ever, but
        		as they moved closer, they could see that all was not as they left it.
        		A great mass of activity bustled around the gates, people
        		lugging stone and timber this way and that, all beneath the
        		watchful eyes of sentinels who stood dutifully atop the wall.
        		One particular blond-bearded dwarf in plate armor - <span class="future">Captain Aerun</span> - stood atop the gate shouting
        		orders to everyone in sight.
        	</p>
        	<img src="npcs/Captain Aerun.png" class="left" />
        	<p>
        		Although the activity didn't appear especially rushed
        		or frantic - indeed, they saw people pausing to talk or jest
        		with one another as they worked (and when Captain Aerun wasn'’'t
        		looking) - it appeared as though Overlook were mobilizing
        		for war.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		Our heroes were hailed as they approached, while the sentinels
        		atop the walls and by the gates offered friendly
        		but careful greetings. Multiple crossbows were trained
        		on the party until they identified themselves, but once
        		they did, their welcome became far warmer. Several
        		workers and soldiers stopped to clap their hands, and
        		the sentinels swiftly lowered their weapons and stood
        		taller at their posts. Word had spread of their heroics
        		on behalf of the city so far, and their return was seen
        		as a good omen.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		Speaking with the blond-beared dwarf officer:
        	</p>
        	<blockquote>
        		"Well met, members of the Dusk Wardens, and welcome back to Overlook. I am 
        		Captain Aerun. Yes, the city is making preparations
        		for war, though I don't personally see the need. It's not that we anticipate any specific
        		trouble, and indeed, the Council of Elders and the
        		various priesthoods hope that, with
        		the defeat of the orc invasion and the closing of the
        		Shadowfell gate, this city is good and safe for a
        		long time to come. Still, recent troubles have stirred
        		up a strong <i>better safe than slaughtered</i> mentality
        		among the populace and the city leaders, and so
        		the Council of Elders have ordered that Overlook's
        		defenses be repaired and enhanced. I've been placed in charge of the effort."
        	</blockquote>
        	<p>
        		Settling back in at Overlook our heroes took a moment to relax and recuperate after their 
        		travels and ordeals. Festivus went in search of her ocassional lover Bram Ironfell - only 
        		to find he was called out of town on business for the Elsir Consortium. Barases scoured 
        		the city for signs his brother Petraynus had ever passed through. And Kallista once again 
        		nearly drank herself into the gutter. Ultimately the party collected that evening at the 
        		Pig and Bucket Tavern, which is were Nerislove Stoneheart found them.
        	</p>
        	<img src="npcs/Nerislove Stoneheart.png" class="right" />
        	<blockquote>
        		"Begging your pardon, m'lords and ladies, but you look
        		familiar to me. You are the folks who saved us from the orcs,
        		and from those foul creatures of shadow, aren't you?...
        		Well, I'm sorry to disturb you and all, but there's someone
        		been looking for you. Woman named Lavinya? She's
        		a priestess at the temple of Erathis, over in the Divine
        		Knot. She's been leaving messages all over town - says she
        		desperately needs to speak with you. She begs you to come
        		see her at the temple, just as soon as you can get there."
        	</blockquote>
        	<p>
        		The next day our heroes answered Lavinya's call and went to the Divine Knot.
        		They cannot help but notice, as they pass, that the old temple
        		of Moradin appears to be under as much construction as
        		the city ramparts. Great frameworks and ladders stood
        		alongside the building, and they could see lumber stacked
        		along the inner walls through the open windows. 
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		When our heroes inquired about the work going on at the old temple,
        		one of the locals reported:
        	</p>
        	<blockquote>
        		“Oh, that. High Ancestor Durkik recently assigned most
        		of his underpriests to restoring the old temple. Something
        		about wanting to expand, I think, so that other races who
        		might not be comfortable in the Stonehammer district
        		could return to Moradin.”		
        	</blockquote>
        	<p>
        		When they finally reached the temple of Erathis it was obvious 
        		that the priesthood of Erathis had seen better days.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		It was all but impossible to tell what color the stones of the
        		temple might once have been, for then they were a repugnant
        		mixture of smoke-stained gray, dirty-handprint brown,
        		and bird-dropping white. The stenches of the Nine Bells
        		district appeared to congregate there, as though seeking
        		admittance and absolution, and our heroes had seen zombies
        		that looked (and smelled) healthier than some of the
        		unfortunate, impoverished souls shambling along the
        		streets with empty eyes.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		Three wide steps that didn't appear to have been swept
        		in days rose toward a heavy wooden door that boasted a
        		relatively fresh coat of polish - one that could not begin to
        		conceal the rot beneath.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		When our heroes
        		entered they saw a largely empty cathedral, its pews old
        		and candles burned down to nubs. At the far end
        		stood an altar to Erathis, which was far better maintained
        		than anything around it. A dark-haired and
        		gold-robed half-elf, grown old before her time, knelt
        		before the altar, rising and turning at the sound of the
        		door.
        	</p>
        	<img src="npcs/Lavinya.png" class="left" />
        	<blockquote>
        		"Thank you. I knew Erathis would guide you to me."
        	</blockquote>
        	<p>
        		For a few moments she waited on the party, offering
        		what comfort she could, pointing them toward the pews
        		at the front of the cathedral (the cleanest ones), offering
        		a few glasses of cheap wine, and the like. After a 
        		pause she frowned thoughtfully and began:
        	</p>
        	<blockquote>
        		<p>
        			"My name is Lavinya. I'm the last priestess
        			here; the others all departed years ago, when the Nine Bells
        			went all to seed, and the temples with it. I keep it open and
        			functioning as best I can on my own, but...
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			Do you know Haelyn?
        			Haelyn is a wonderful old woman. She's the caretaker of
        			the shrine to Erathis, over in Tradetown.
        			I'm sure you know that most worship of
        			Erathis in Overlook takes place there, rather than here. I
        			must admit, I haven't always been a friend to Haelyn. I
        			was...bitter, very bitter, at what happened to my temple.
        			But after a time, we got to know each other, and we've
        			become great friends."
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			And that's why I need you! Something is wrong! Something's
        			happened to Haelyn, I know it, and maybe not just to her!
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			A few weeks ago, Haelyn just disappeared. I went by the
        			shrine to speak with her and she was gone. There's a man
        			named Grovald maintaining the shrine now. I don't know
        			him; I've never met him before, and nobody I talk to knows
        			him, either. He told me that Haelyn left on a spiritual
        			retreat and would be back in a few months.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			But I know better! Haelyn needed no 'spiritual retreat.'
        			Her faith was strong, and it was centered on that shrine!
        			And even if she had, she wouldn't have up and left - not
        			without telling me.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			I must confess, I went back at night and snooped around a
        			bit, not just in the shrine, but peering through the windows
        			of the groundskeeper's cottage. I've offered penance to
        			Erathis for my trespass, but I had to know what happened!
        			I didn't...I found no trace of Haelyn, but I did catch a
        			glimpse of a letter through the cracks in the shutters. I
        			couldn't read much of it, and I dared not stay long, but
        			I'm certain it was addressed to 'G' - that must be Grovald,
        			right? - and it began with 'I am commanded to ask if you've
        			had any further problems with the worshipers of...' That's
        			all I saw, but it sounds sinister enough!
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			And that, is where things got even
        			worse. I went to the authorities, but they told me there was
        			nothing to look into, that Haelyn - or any citizen - can travel
        			as they please. I spoke to some of the other priests - Aelys of
        			Bahamut, Durkik of Moradin at the Stone Anvil, Kyrrist of
        			Avandra, even Matron Volorvyn of the Raven Queen. Some
        			of these have long been my friends, and even those who
        			were not have at least been respected colleagues. And all of
        			them brushed me off! They were distant, uncaring, even
        			cold, as though my worries were of no moment! Volorvyn
        			appeared barely to recognize me, and while we've never
        			been close, we've known one another on and off for years.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			And that's when I thought of you, Overlook's new heroes.
        			I'm terrified that something has happened to my friend and
        			that something is wrong with my fellow priests. I should,
        			we all should, be showering you with gifts and thanks, not
        			heaping even more cares onto your shoulders - but I've little
        			influence left in this city, and I have nobody else to whom I
        			can turn."
        		</p>
        	</blockquote>
        	<p>
        		When our heroes agreed to investigate, Lavinya smiled gratefully.
        	</p>
        	<blockquote>
        		<p>
        			"You could talk to one of the priests, I suppose. I'm not sure they'd agree to speak
        			with you at any length, though. Everyone's so busy with the
        			mobilization. And these are important people; you can't
        			just, uh, 'hero' your way into the building and confront
        			them. Still you might learn something from them.
        		</p>
        		<p>
        			You could examine the shrine of Erathis. You might
        			well find something I missed. Or you could search Haelyn's
        			home, which is on the same lot as the shrine. I looked for
        			her there, but when she didn't answer, it felt wrong for me to
        			just barge in. But now..."
        		</p>
        	</blockquote>
        	<p>
        		On the way to the temple of Erathis in Tradetown our heroes stopped in 
        		at the old temple of Moradin to investigate the construction. 
        		The amount of work going on there made the place look
        		less like a house of worship and more like an anthill on a
        		massive scale. Workers of all races scurried through doors
        		and windows, clambering up scaffolds of wood and iron.
        		The sounds of grunts, curses, shouted orders, and the
        		monotonous thump of hammers on nails made it all but
        		impossible to hear oneself think.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		The work continued inside as well as out. Workers with
        		boards on their shoulders, wheelbarrows, or heavy
        		hammers moved back and forth. The floor was
        		covered with dust, both stone and wood, and heaps of rubble
        		lay in every corner.
        	</p>
        	<img src="npcs/Megan Swiftblade.png" class="right" />
        	<p>
        		Not everyone there was a simple laborer, however. Leaning
        		against the leftmost wall, her eyes narrowing as she
        		watched our heroes, was a young, heavily muscled woman clad in
        		scale armor. One hand rested on the hilt of a longsword at
        		her waist.
        	</p>
        	<blockquote>
        		"Well, if it isn't the 'great heroes' of Overlook. Sorry, but

        		When our heroes attempt to push past, abruptly, one of the dwarf workers turned and stops in front
        		of the party, coming within inches of running his wheelbarrow
        		over Lechonero’s foot. He hitched his
        		thumbs through his belt - a gesture that put one hand

        	<p>
        		Murrik Hammerfist continued to antagonize our heroes, several of his

        	</p>

        		to look dangerous to me."
        	</blockquote>
        	<p>
        		Just as things appeared ready to escalate into violence 
        		a red-bearded dwarf, clad in worker's leathers and a smock
        		but with the hammer of Moradin hanging about his neck,
        		pushes his way through the crowd. 
        	</p>
        	<blockquote>
        		"All right, all of you back
        		to work! I'm Ancestor Karros of Moradin.
        		Why don't I escort you out?"
        	</blockquote>
        	<p>
        		On the way out our heroes softened Ancestor Karros up and got him 
        		to talk.
        		He was concerned that High Ancestor Durkik had assigned almost the entire
        		staff of the Stone Anvil to working on the reconstruction
        		of the old temple. He had barely kept enough
        		priests on hand there to conduct regular services.
        		Karros didn't speak ill of High Ancestor Durkik, but he hinted at the
        		fact that he didn't approve. The idea of the renovation
        		came out of nowhere, and neither Karros nor
        		the other priests could figure out why it's being done.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		High Ancestor Durkik called for investors from Overlook's
        		dwarves to aid in the reconstruction. The Hammerfist 
        		Clan was among those to contribute money and
        		workers. Many of the workers had been speaking
        		poorly about the party any time their status as
        		"heroes" came up in conversation.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		Although he appeared almost unwilling to admit it,
        		Karros confessed that Durkik hadn't been himself
        		for weeks now. He was worried about the old priest.
        	</p>
            <img src="places/The Stone Anvil.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                Parting ways with Ancestor Karros our heroes proceeded to 
                the primary temple of Moradin - the Stone Anvil - in order 
                to investigate Ancestor Karros' claims about High Ancestor 
                Durkik.
            </p>
            <p>
                As compared to so much of the rest of Overlook, the
                Stonehammer district might almost be a different city.
                Broad, clean streets flow like rivers of rock between
                enormous, sweeping edifices, carved with near magical
                precision. The air is clean there, and the voices heard
                are raised in laughter or negotiation, without the tinge of
                desperation so common in some of the poorer quarters.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then our heroes were there. It rose up before them like a
                fortress, constructed of blocks of stone larger than many of
                Overlook's houses. At its height, looking down upon even its
                tallest neighboring buildings, glint leaded windows in the
                shape of hammers. The doors at the entryway stood open,
                inviting all who would worship, and a good thing it was - for
                these doors are 40 feet high if they're an inch, and the lot of
                our heroes together might have difficulty dragging them open.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the Stone Anvil, temple of Moradin and the
                spiritual heart of Overlook. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the sanctuary - which is no less
                sweeping, magnificent, and ostentatious than the
                building's exterior - our heroes saw about a hundred worshipers
                engaged in prayer,
                heads bowed and chanting in low, sonorous voices. 
                The overwhelming majority of the faithful there
                were dwarves. The services were being led by a young
                dwarf female who read from a great, steel-bound
                tome that, when open, was nearly as broad as she was.
                There was no sign here of anything out of the ordinary,
                or of High Ancestor Durkik himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things didn't appear so mundane in the halls surrounding the main
                sanctuary, however.
                A great many tasks appeared to have been left undone;
                floors were not swept, candelabras were unpolished,
                torches and braziers had been allowed to burn out.
                Inquiring about this some acolytes explain that most of 
                High Ancestor Durkik's underpriests were
                currently hard at work restoring the old temple in the
                Divine Knot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Asking for an audience with High Ancestor Durkik, our heroes were left
                waiting, and when they attempted to explore on their own, going deeper into the
                temple than most worshipers ever travel, they were quickly interrupted. Within mere moments, High
                Ancestor Durkik appeared, accompanied by a contingent
                of the city watch. He demanded, in no uncertain
                terms, that our heroes depart immediately. The guards
                were apologetic, but adamant. High Ancestor Durkik had the legal and religious
                authority to demand that they leave, and the
                guards were there to ensure they did just that.    
            </p>
        	<p>
        		Thrown out of the Stone Anvil our heroes proceeded on 
        		to Tradetown and the other temple of Erathis.
        		As compared to Overlook's other temples, this shrine was poor
        		indeed - and yet it offers a sense of intimacy that the greater
        		edifices did not. Several wooden poles stuck in the earth
        		supported walls and ceiling of heavy fabric, barely enough
        		to keep the rain off the altar within it. The altar was littered
        		with candle stubs and scraps of parchment, which were the
        		remnants of prayers and offerings.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		Beyond the makeshift sanctuary, a statue of Erathis
        		stood in the middle of a pool of stagnant water, staring
        		off toward the horizon. Many of the bricks of the pool
        		were broken or missing, and a closer glance suggested that
        		the "statue" was in fact a fountain at one point, but the
        		mechanism had failed - likely many years ago.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		Several rickety cottages stood on the edge of the
        		property, apparently held together by little more than faith
        		and an extra coating of paint.
        	</p>
        	<img src="npcs/Grovald.png" class="left" />
        	<p>
        		Several townsfolk moved in and out of the curtain-housed
        		shrine, leaving written prayers on the altar and occasionally
        		glancing askance at a fellow who paces behind it. He is a tall
        		human, bald-headed with features sharp as an eagle's, clad
        		all in somber black. He muttered to himself as he paced.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		It was pretty clear from his body language that the
        		man didn't want to be there, though any time one of the
        		citizens utters a prayer to Erathis, he replied with a quick
        	</p>
        	<blockquote>
        		"So may it be."
        	</blockquote>
        	<p>
        		When our heroes spoke with him, he introduced himself as
        		Grovald. He answered some questions about Haelyn
        		with the same "spiritual retreat" story he gave Lavinya.
        		He claimed not to know where she went or when she would be back,
        		though he was less than convincing.
        		After that he dismissed the heroes, claiming to be busy praying
        		along with his faithful. 
        	</p>
            <p>
                When our heroes attempted to search the groundss Grovald threatened 
                to call the city watch - forcing them to back off. 
            </p>
        	<p>
        		After the quick exchange with Grovald, 
        		one of the faithful, an older woman dressed in shabby but
        		well-mended shawl and dress, stood up from the altar and
        		turned her eyes on our heroes. 
        	</p>
        	<blockquote>
        		"I know you! Thank you so much for all you've done!
        		I couldn't help but overhear, and a lot of
        		us have asked him the same questions. We don't trust him,
        		and we're worried about Haelyn. Almost nobody comes
        		here after dark anymore, so if you want the chance to talk to
        		him in private, when he's not so 'busy,' that'd be a good time
        		to come back. Maybe you can find out what's going on."
        	</blockquote>
        	<p>
                Returning at night under the cover of invisibility, Kitara 
                searched the temple grounds and Haelyn's cottage. The small cottage 
                on the grounds of the shrine looked
                comfortable, but old and rickety. Bricks were missing from
                the chimney, and the paint was peeling from the walls.
        	</p>
        	<p>
                Picking the lock, Kitara snuck inside; the dust of days, if not weeks, 
                lay over a homey little abode.
                An ash-filled fireplace stood in one corner, with an old
                table and two equally old, but comfortable looking, chairs
                beside it. A pantry stood alongside a door that would
                almost have to lead to the bedroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                A faint stench, foul and out of place with the cottage's
                peaceful appearance, tickled her nostrils. The stench was coming from the pantry, which
                contained several rotting vegetables, fruits, and cuts
                of meat, all swarming with ants and fruit flies. The
                perishable foods in the pantry and a chest of
                clothes almost completely full were not signs of someone
                who was preparing for a long journey.
        	</p>
        	<p>
                Startled as Grovald entered the cottage, Kitara slipped back out again 
                but saw Grovald light a fire in the fireplace and throw some papers into the fire.
                She quickly scaled the rickety chimney and used Mage Hand to draw the burning paper up 
                the chimney into her hands. Though partially destroyed, the remains read:
        	</p>
            <blockquote>
                "...unreachable for a time, as I must...the priests'
                orders as you would my own, for he...s always, be
                certain you destroy this mis...
                ...eneral Zi..."
            </blockquote>
        	<p>
                Their suspicions aroused, Barases spoke to the plants on the temple grounds, 
                and discovered that behind the fountain, not far from the nearest tree, a faint
                bulge in the earth marred the contours of the soil. It looked as
                though something was buried there recently.
        	</p>
        	<p>
                Summoning the city watch, our heroes levelled their accusations against Grovald 
                and when the watch dug up the mound behind the fountain discovered Haelyn's 
                buried remains and carted Grovald off to prison.
        	</p>
        	<p>
                Meanwhile, Kallista and Bin went to the authorities about Grovald and were directed to the Ministry of
                War - specifically, the office wherein the officers of the city garrison work. The Ministry of War was 
                huge, consisting of six buildings
                arrayed around a central courtyard - all within an imposing
                set of guard walls, of course. As they approached the gate, two
                guards, a dwarf and a dragonborn, stepped forward and crossed
                their spears before them.
        	</p>
            <blockquote>
                "State your business within."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Demanded the dwarf. Despite the gruff welcome, the guards were just doing their duty and 
                ushered the pair into the office - one of the buildings nearest the main entrance to the compound. 
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Captain Aerun.png" class="right" />
            <p>
                A dwarf stood up from behind the desk as they entered. His
                blond beard was tightly braided, his armor brightly polished.
                It took them only a moment to recognize him as the officer
                they saw shouting orders from the wall when they first
                arrived in Overlook.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "I'm Captain Aerun. I'm
                honored to have Overlook's heroes in my office. What can I
                help you with?"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Aerun listened intently and politely, scowling in
                anger when Kallista mentioned some of the vile things
                she had seen, and shaking his head at the evidence against 
                Grovald.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "These are indeed grave matters you bring to me.
                I'll get looking into them at once. And you once again
                have the thanks of a grateful city. Go on and take a load
                off, wherever you're staying. I'll let you know how the
                investigation turns out."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Kallista was suspicious of this apparent brush-off, feeling 
                Captain Aerun was more interested in keeping them out of
                the investigation than he was in finding out the truth. In 
                response Bin disguised herself as a dwarven clerical worker 
                in the offices and began investigating Aerun himself. Though 
                she found nothing explicitly incriminating, his plans for bolstering the defense 
                of Overlook were wraught with inefficiencies and many apparently 
                valid complaints about suspicious activity in the city were going unanswered.
                Additionally, Captain Aerun appeared to be in the habit of leaving the 
                Ministry of War on regular "personal" errands unaccounted for in his 
                schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kallista took it upon herself to covertly tail Captain Aerun while he 
                went on one of his errands. Though he led her on a merry chase, ultimately 
                she followed him to the Pig and Bucket tavern. Most of the building's interior consisted of the beer hall.
                Booths lined the walls, while long tables and rear-bruising
                benches filled the middle of the room between. Along the far
                wall ran a wooden bar - she could see the graffiti carved into
                it even from the door - behind which stood stacks of kegs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kallista managed to resist the temptation of the kegs just long enough to summon the 
                rest of the Dusk Wardens. Sneaking covertly into shadowy stalls in the tavern they saw 
                Captain Aerun in one of the far booths, speaking to a scruffy looking
                individual in a shabby gray cloak. After Captain Aerun left the tavern they once again 
                attempted to follow him, when without warning, a number of thugs came charging from
                around corners and out of doorways, and holding their blades high!  
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Alley Ambush.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                The majority of the party stayed to confront the attackers but Kallista snuck off ahead to 
                continue her pursuit of Captain Aerun. When our heroes dispatched their ambushers the bodies 
                at their feet warped and shifted - the skin turned pale
                gray and the eyes grew wide and dark. This was no human
                who lay before them! They were dopplegangers, and one had a list of descriptions on it - descriptions 
                of our heroes themselves. The list was stained with beer and sausage grease - which Festivus recognized 
                as coming from the Pig and Bucket tavern menu they had just left. <span class="future">Captain Aerun had 
                set them up!</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile Kallista darted behind pedestrians, into doorways, and through
                shadows, moving street to street without being seen. Using her knowledge 
                of the seedier areas of Overlook she guessed that Captain Aerun was headed 
                into the Blister. With less crowds to work with, Kallista instead 
                darted around corners, climbed walls, tumbled over a gaps
                between rooftops, and leapt between
                roofs and balconies to stays near Captain Aerun at
                angles that made her harder to detect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately she followed him to his destination - a warehouse in the Blister district.
                Nothing in particular made the warehouse stand out. It was
                a large, squat building, with a huge front door that opened
                by sliding up into the ceiling on rails. A rickety wooden
                staircase along one wall lead to a door that
                opened onto an upper level.        
            </p>
            <img src="places/Zithiruun's warehouse.png" class="right" />
            <p>
                When the rest of the party caught up to Kallista, they entered the warehouse by force.
                A vast chamber stretched before them. Rows upon rows of
                crates - some stacked as high as 15 feet - formed aisles and
                corridors. A catwalk ran around the perimeter, as well as
                across the cavernous room at several points, with an array
                of chains and pulleys dangling beneath.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Zithiruun's warehouse.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                Several gruff-looking fellows, the sort you might
                not want to meet in a dark alley but wouldn't be surprised
                to find there, lurked atop the catwalk, atop several crates, and
                around a few corners, crossbows held at the ready.
                Among them was Goodman Kyrrist (a priest of Avondra).
            </p>
            <p>
                A few other foes stood hiding in the shadows, also
                aiming weapons at our heroes. Their gray flesh and huge dark
                eyes were strong indications that they were not human! <span class="future">They were doppelgangers.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                In one corner, a flight of stairs led to a balcony built into
                the catwalk. Several walls surrounded what was
                an office or counting house, which was occupied by little more 
                than a table, a chair - and Captain Aerun, shock evident on his 
                face as he rose. he wall behind him boasted a shuttered, glass-free 
                window.
            </p>
            <p>
                As our heroes burst into the office Captain Aerun did a seemingly 
                impossible thing - he flew backward through the window - as if on 
                strings and floated gracefully down to the warehouse floor <span class="future">He performed a telekinetic leap.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                The encountered devolved into a pitched ranged battle across the catwalks and crates - ultimately Barases summoned a 
                crocodile to root the snipers out of their hiding places. With the gang dispatched, our heroes searched the warehouse 
                and discovered a hidden trap door leading down into a narrow, stone-walled hallway. Mildew
                darkened the mortar between the bricks and filled the air
                with the damp scent of rot. A steel door, speckled with rust,
                stood at the far end of the hall. It boasted a small barred
                window - through which our heroes saw a dwarf, his flesh bruised and beaten, his hair and beard
                matted with blood, standing chained to the far wall of a
                stench-ridden, claustrophobic cell. It took them a moment
                to recognize him as none other than High Ancestor Durkik
                Forgeheart!
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/High Ancestor Durkik.png" class="right" />
            <p>
                Slowly, as though even so minor a move pained him,
                he looked up to meet their gaze through the bars, his eyes
                widening slightly as he recognized our heroes. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Be careful. The door's trapped. And not to kill you, either.
                They don't want me escaping."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                He gestured with a finger, the chain clinking, to indicate
                a series of tubes that protruded from the walls of the cell,
                pointing in his direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kitara worked for several stressful minutes to disable the spike 
                tubes before unlocking the cell and freeing High Ancestor Durkik.
                The dwarf slowly limped from his cell, wincing with every
                step. Clearly he was in a great deal of pain, but despite that
                fact, his eyes were alert.

                    As you've no doubt surmised, I was kidnapped and held here -

                    These conspirators work for someone called General Zithiruun. I 
                    haven't seen his face, but he wears a hooded cloak and a strange 
                    leather-and-steel harness. He questioned me at length - though 
                    I gave him nothing - but his focus on holding the Stone Anvil 
                    let me guess what he's after: Mountainroot Temple.

                    It's a subterranean structure underneath the Stonehome Mountains built by the same order that
                    would later go on to construct the Monastery of the
                    Sundered Chain. Built when
                    the dwarves were still celebrating their freedom
                    from the giants, it was not a dwarven structure, but a
                    temple built for anyone who wanted to pay tribute to
                    Moradin, of any race. It held great reliquaries of holy
                    icons, enormous cathedrals where hundreds could
                    worship at once, and even a doorway to the Astral
                    Plane whence angels and exarchs of Moradin would
                    appear to discourse with the god's most favored
                    priests and champions. To facilitate a grand community
                    of Moradin worshipers, the Mountainroot Temple
                    had, in addition to its astral doors and its main
                    entryway into the mountains, four mystical doorways
                    constructed. Each linked to another temple of
                    Moradin elsewhere in the world, so the faithful could
                    come and go with ease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And for decades, even centuries, the temple
                    thrived. Slowly, however, relations between
                    Moradin's faithful grew strained. Priests assigned
                    to other, "lesser" temples grew envious of those at
                    Mountainroot. Many of the dwarf faithful grew
                    haughty, considering themselves Moradin's "true"
                    children, and sought to oust all others, or at least put
                    them in lesser places, denying them access to the
                    temple's wonders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Was it Moradin's wrath? A curse brought upon
                    them by the giants they'd so long ago escaped? Or
                    simply a natural catastrophe without greater meaning?
                    None can say. Whatever the case, some centuries
                    ago, the mountain was struck by an earthquake.
                    Portions of the inner tunnels collapsed, damaging
                    several chambers of the Mountainroot Temple,
                    destroying others entirely. Panicked, the priests and
                    the faithful grabbed up their treasures and holy
                    icons - at least most of them - and fled using the surviving
                    magical portals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once they'd settled elsewhere, the bulk of
                    Moradin's priests decided that this way was better.
                    By scattering from the temple, they would allow the
                    dwarves to build their own shrines, without feeling
                    constrained by the other races, and the jealousy
                    that marred the priesthood would fade. Although
                    they mourned the loss of the great cathedral, and
                    those few treasures they'd been unable to save, they
                    declared the quake to have been Moradin's will and
                    left the temple abandoned. In time, most faithful,
                    even most priests save those most thoroughly learned
                    in their history, forgot it had ever been.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most, but not all. After a few decades, a small
                    group of Moradin worshipers - mostly dwarves, but
                    with members of other races as well - returned to the
                    Mountainroot Temple. They cleaned it up as best they
                    could and vowed to maintain it until it should some
                    day become important once again. The most powerful
                    of their number took on the title of Caretaker and
                    lived within the temple, in a small structure built
                    inside the larger reliquary. The Caretaker carefully
                    attuned himself to the temple's surviving magic,
                    allowing him to control the constructs and divine
                    defenses and traps that protected the structure from
                    outside invasion.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a member of that order I am one of the few who know 
                    about the Mountainroot Temple - though I am not the Caretaker and 
                    as such I am forbidden to enter it. I merely provide the Caretaker 
                    with supplies. Somehow Zithiruun knows about the temple and was 
                    questioning me about its magic and security. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you've doubtless guessed, the Stone Anvil contains one of those portals to
                    the Mountainroot Temple. I don't know why this General
                    Zithiruun wants the temple, but it's clearly what he's after.
                    It's funny, he's had me tortured for days to make me
                    describe the Mountainroot's mystical defenses, but the
                    truth is, I don't know much about them. I know about the
                    temple only because, as High Priest, I was told of it by my
                    predecessor. I can tell you that the defenses are psychically
                    linked to the Caretaker, allowing him to control them, but
                    beyond that, I know little. But even had I told them that
                    much, I doubt they'd have believed me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few days ago Zithiruun stormed off insisting he was going to 
                    'find out for himself.' Chances are that's were he is now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't know why he wants the temple, but I
                    know it cannot be good for us. I know not who else in this
                    city might have been compromised - who can be trusted.
                    That leaves only you.

                    The entrance from the Stone Anvil is carefully hidden
                    within an old sepulcher. The chamber is hidden behind a
                    secret door; I can escort you to it, but no farther. What I
                    cannot do is tell you how to access the portal, for I don't know,
                    and I am oathbound never to enter the sepulcher. But my
                    hope is that, once you find it, you can figure out how to use it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I must ask you one thing more. When
                    the Mountainroot Temple was abandoned, the priesthood
                    took most of our ancient religious relics with them. Most,
                    but not all. Somewhere within the temple lies a tome
                    entitled, when translated into Common, the Incunabulum
                    Primeval. It is a book of great power for those who know
                    how to use it. If you can find it and return it to us, I can
                    promise you a reward of no less than 3,600 gp from the
                    temple treasury, as well as legal right to any other treasure
                    you find in, and can carry out of, the Mountainroot."

                Durkik lead our heroes
                back through the city and the towering halls of the Stone Anvil.
                Several of the priests and guards appeared nervous
                about allowing them to pass, but none were prepared
                to gainsay their guide.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a dozen halls and several wide stairs, Durkik stopped
                inside a great chamber. Shelves of old scrolls lined the stone
                walls, and great marble tables occuppied the room's center. Dust
                lay thick over it all, proving that this room was rarely used.
                For a few moments, the priest fumbled with the scrolls
                on one particular rack. Finally, a loud click resounded
                throughout the room, and one of the walls slid open with
                a deafening rumble and a cascade of powdered stone.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "This is it - the sepulcher. I cannot go any

            <p>
                Our heroes were left standing at one end of a long chamber. Chandeliers
                hanging from the ceiling sprang to life even as they passed
                through the secret door, illuminating all that lay before them.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the right and left, stairs led down to an open lower
                level, transforming the floor on which they were standing into a
                central walkway, with two narrower ledges along both sides
                of the room. At even intervals along those walkways the
                floor abruptly widened, almost like the teeth on a gear.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the far end of the chamber, a bright silver filigree of
                unimaginable complexity bulged from the wall. It showed a
                scene of Moradin hard at work at his forge. Four statues - 
                two flanking the filigree, two flanking the entrance - showed
                Moradin with a pair of ravens perched on his shoulders.
                Perhaps these were meant to honor the Raven Queen, who
                watches over even Moradin's dead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once they had come closer, our heroes could see an old stone door
                in the wall behind the filigree image. They could not, however, see
                a way to access it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately Kitara touched the filigree in an attempt to get through 
                to the door.
                The image suddenly bent as the face of Moradin turned
                toward her and spoke in a voice of rending metal: 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Who
                would step through the portal to the heart of Moradin's
                worship must first prove he understands Moradin in his
                own heart.
                Think you carefully on Moradin's precepts, his
                teachings, his actions, and his favored disciples. Then speak
                unto me a parable, a tale of Moradin, not that you have
                learned from his texts, but that you have created yourself.
                Let it show your understanding of his words and his ways,
                and you may pass."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Unfortunately the party's largely atheistic ways left them 
                ignorant of the finer points of Moradin's dogma and a magical 
                trap was sprung. From the iron image, thin strings of metal - liquid, as
                though melting - shot forth. They struck not at our heroes, but
                at several of the hanging chandeliers, forming a canopy of
                metallic strands overhead. From those chandeliers, great
                lengths of chain dropped to the floor and then reared up like
                striking serpents.
            </p>
            <p>
                After dismembering the chains and rendering the precious filigree 
                asunder, our heroes forced their way through the heavy stone door.
                They felt no magic - no tingling or shimmering. It occured
                between steps; one instant, they were in the sepulcher, and
                the next they were...not. They emerged into a great, stone-walled
                chamber. Numerous doorways - many of which were
                contained within deep stone arches, almost like artificial
                caves - provided egress. A platform with multiple stairs
                stood near the chamber's center, presumably for a
                ceremonial purpose long since forgotten. The eastern
                portion of the room appeared to have been largely damaged
                in an ancient cave-in, marring one of two great reliefs that
                adorned the far wall.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Mountainroot Temple.png" class="left" />
            <img src="npcs/Slystone dwarf ruffian.png" class="right" />
            <p>
                Perched on one of the archways and atop the
                undamaged relief, a pair of foul females with ragged hair
                and the claws and wings of vultures turned piercing eyes in
                our heroes' direction, letting loose with a terrible, predatory cry.
                Only a few yards away, what appeared to be a scruffy,
                abnormally short dwarf <span class="future">slystone dwarf ruffian</span> peered at them between slitted lids.
                From the corner of his eye, Lechonero spotted a second
                thuggish-looking dwarf skulking quietly in the shadows of
                the broken wall.    
            </p>
            <p>
                After a quick skirmish with the fey our heroes found they were trapped -  
                they couldn't return through the door way they entered through nor any of 
                the other portals in the room. Instead they headed deeper into the temple. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Passing out of the room and down a narrow passageway they emerged into a 
                mostly empty chamber containing a small round table and a few chairs. 
                Several cracked teacups and ale mugs,
                covered in dust and cobwebs, stood on the table where they
                were abandoned so long ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                Off through one door, wooden racks lined the walls of the next room, empty and dust-covered. From
                their size and shape, Festivus guessed that they once held bottles
                of wine and kegs of ale.    
            </p>
            <p>
                The other door led to a room containing several long tables, capable of seating dozens, stretching the
                length of the room. Chairs were scattered about, some having
                been knocked over or broken just recently. A few humanoid
                corpses - small, with gray skin and wicked teeth <span class="future">quicklings</span> - lay strewn
                about. Of whatever slew them, there was no sign.    
            </p>
            <p>
        		Backtracking, Lechonero discovered a secret passage from the tea room into an uneven room that was 
        		clearly a repository of a sort. The
        		walls were of heavy stone - heavier, even, than any seen 
        		elsewhere in the temple - and several short flights of stairs
        		led to vaultlike rooms. These separate chambers boasted
        		heavy portcullises, though the gates were all raised.
            </p>
            <p>
        		Three twisted, grotesque little humanoids, with deadgray
        		skin and inhuman features <span class="future">quicklings</span>, dropped the coins they were
        		examining as our heroes entered. They were joined by another pair of harpies, skulking just
        		beyond two of the entries to the vaults!
            </p>
            <p>
        		After a heated combat that ranged across the room (setting off daggerspring floor traps)
        		our heroes bested the fey and claimed the riches of the vault for themselves - including 
        		a wicked looking spiked chain kept under lock and key. Searching the room our heroes discovered 
        		a secret passage down through a trapdoor but chose to explore the rest of the temple first.

        		Returning to exit through the kitchens, our heroes emerged into an enormous area.
        		Some of our heroes had seen keeps smaller than the vast chamber
        		around them. Roughly oval in shape, save for the crumbling
        		walls to the east, the chamber consisted of multiple levels.
        		Stairs in the room's center, as well as great sweeping ramps
        		around the sides, climbing to the second level 20 feet above.
        		One of those ramps had partly collapsed along with the
        		walls. Steep stairs and slopes led from there to a third
        		level, and a platform not unlike the one in the temple's entry
        		chamber stood high atop that. Huge chunks of wall and
        		stone stood along the broken edge, forming natural ledges,
        		and a deep crevice ran a jagged path to the southeast.
            </p>
            <p>
        		The room was filled with malicious fey: another of the vile, bestial-looking dwarves <span class="future">slystone dwarf ruffian</span>
        		was hiding in the lee of the stairs. Above, there were several insectoid-featured
        		humanoids <span class="future">banshrae dartswarmers</span> perched on various ledges. And there 
        		were yet more foes - twisted gray
        		humanoids roughly the size of halflings <span class="future">quickling runners</span>, lurking around
        		various corners and in the shadows.
            </p>
            <img src="pcs/Smudge.png" class="right" />
            <p>
        		After a few moments of combat with the fey, 
        		a deafening boom rang out over the chamber, echoing
        		through the vastness. Twice, three times, and then they heard
        		a sudden shattering and the sound of wood rebounding off
        		stone as the double doors burst open, and jagged bits of the lock
        		hung loose. Through the open doorway barged an array of
        		horrific figures: several green and mottled trolls, a pair of
        		smaller creatures with similar features and narrowed eyes <span class="future">spitting trolls</span>,
        		and - most terrifyingly - a broad-shouldered troll with two
        		shrieking heads. Accompanying one of the small trolls was a
        		red-scaled reptile on a heavy chain, smoke rising from its
        		nostrils and from between its jagged teeth <span class="future">Smudge</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
        		In an epic three-way battle our heroes emerged victorious over both 
        		the fey and the trolls. Lechonero managed to tame the Redspawn Firebelcher 
        		(over Barases' heated objections) and named him Smudge.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Smudge in tow our heroes headed east through the collapsed tunnels. 
                Climbing up from the crevice, they had a brief instant to look
                around. They were in a cathedral or religious sanctuary, far
                smaller than the main one behind them, and the hall boasted
                a dais at the far end, behind which loomed a great relief of
                Moradin at his forge. A line of columns ran down both sides
                of the room; two of the great pillars had fallen, apparently
                toppled in the same cataclysm that created the crevice.
                And then their brief moment of observation had passed, as
                a cadre of one-eyed giants, axes held high, converged on our heroes!
                Joining the cyclops were a handful of gnome-sized fey skulking in the shadows 
                <span class="future">slystone dwarf ruffians</span>,
                and another of the insectoid fey <span class="future">banshrae dartswarmers</span>
                crouched upon the steps of the dais, its unblinking eyes
                gazing in their direction.
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Hethralga.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                Through the melee Kitara spied an old dwarf crone, ancient beyond belief,
                atop the dais, almost blending in to the relief beyond.
                As the combat began in earnest Kitara and the dwarf locked eye and recognition and 
                shock caused the crone to drop her disguise; the dwarf melted away to reveal a 
                Howling Hag - and one Kitara recognized from her past as Hethralga "Our Lady of the Deathly Song", a personal 
                servant of King Cachlain and a member of the coven responsible for her ritual 
                mutilation. Flying into a rage, Kitara charged through the fey directly at Hethralga - 
                who began to flee. Throwing spell after spell at everything in her way Kitara cleared 
                a path to her quarry and with a final spell turned her into a toad.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a last ditch effort to stop her, the cyclops started knocking over the remaining columns 
                in the chamber. A low groan reverberated through the sanctum, sending
                dust raining down from above. And then the rain became far
                more than dust, as bits of rock began to shake loose. Kitara grabbed the toad and dived into 
                the next room to avoid the rockslide.
            </p>
            <p>
                With her troops defeated, our heroes subdued Hethralga once she returned to her normal form and 
                questioned her. Under threat of being left alone with Kitara, Hethralga revealed that King 
                Cachlain had sent her to recover the Incunumbulum Primeval - "a parchment voice" of great power 
                that he had sought for some time time. Only recently, however, had she 
                learned that its retrieval had become urgent, because
                the court's divinations suggested that someone else
                was about to get their hands on it. She admitted that
                Cachlain's new counselor - someone named Sovacles,
                whom she had never met - tried to talk him out of
                sending them, but that the king was too desperate to
                get the book. She explained that they could not leave because of "the Others" - a band of humanoids 
                consisting mostly of trolls - appeared and took the Caretaker prisoner, thus cutting off all 
                possible exit. They had been engaging in regular skirmishes with these "Others". 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "They are organized and serve some higher master. But I do not know who. Perhaps they are the reason 
                Cachlain felt we must retrieve the parchment voice so swiftly. Now? I seek only to escape the temple. A
                portal to the Feywild stands at the base of the mountains,
                where the waters flow from above to reach the
                plains. I would return home - with the Incunabulum
                if possible, but at least with my life."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Through further intimidation she revealed that she already had the 
                tome and exchanged it for her freedom and a pact of non-interference.
        		The tome was an enormous book,
        		nearly 2 feet tall by 18 inches wide, and almost
        		a foot thick. The pages were an incredibly heavy
        		parchment, while the cover consisted of thin
        		planks of wood that were bound and hinged in
        		iron.
        		The book was written in Dwarven, but also in
        		a sort of cipher; no attempt at translating or
        		decoding it functioned without either the proper
        		rituals, known only to the priesthood of Moradin,
        		or magic more potent than any our heroes possessed.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/The Underchambers.png" class="right" />
            <p>
                Wearied from their battles, our heroes retreated to the Underchambers under the Grand Cathedral looking for a place to rest.
                The initial chamber was apparently a foyer or waiting room. A
                ragged rug covered the floor, with a few old indentations
                indicating where chairs used to sit. Through a cloakroom to the northeast
                they entered a room lined with wooden-walled monastic
                cells. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond it lay a
                combination meeting hall and library. A long table sat
                amid a smattering of chairs, and the chamber's western
                side was occupied by a more heavily upholstered chair, a
                bookcase, and a small altar to Moradin. All were covered in a
                fine coating of dust.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last room appeared to be an actual forge,
                which was perhaps used for ceremonial purposes or the
                creation of magic items. Two anvils occupied the room's
                northern side, while a fire pit filled with ancient white-gray
                ashes took up the center of the chamber. Against the south
                wall, a larger anvil stood beneath the unblinking gaze of a
                statue of Moradin.        
            </p>
            <p>
                After disarming a magical trap and dismantling some guardian constructs, our heroes secured the area to rest before pressing on.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the Incunumbulum Primeval in hand and the means to their escape clear, our heroes advanced on the 
                Reliquary north of the Grand Cathedral where Hethralga said the "Others" and teh Caretaker were based.
                They entered a wide corridor. Ahead of them, two flights of
                stairs, separated by a long landing, led to a platform high
                above. Two figures stood atop that platform, apparently
                conversing. One was a rust-hued dragonborn clad in heavy
                armor. The other was a slender figure, its features hidden
                by a hooded cloak. He was clad in a sort of leather-and-steel
                harness. It looked less like armor than like the creation of
                a maddened surgeon - a full-bodysuit version of a brace
                designed to hold a broken limb in place.
            </p>
            <p>
                They saw them only for a split second, for before the door
                had even fully opened, both had stepped away from the
                edge and out of sight.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the top of the stairs four stone stairs came together, forming a small
                platform about 20 feet above a larger, circular surface.
                That surface appeared to be made of glass or crystal,
                allowing a full view of the various chambers below. Some of
                those chambers extended out from beneath the crystal - openroofed
                so that our heroes could still see in. The stairs to the north
                rose upward, rather than down, culminating in a large
                set of double doors several dozen feet above the current
                level, and a pair of massive statues of Moradin stood in the
                northwest and northeast corners. To the southwest stood
                a pair of small buildings - the only structures in the entire
                cavern that appeared to have a roof.
            </p>
            <p>
                An array of humanoid creatures stood scattered about
                the chamber, both on the platform or stairs, and down on
                the ground level. Not a one of them looked especially thrilled
                to see our heroes.
            </p>
            <p>
                A pitched battle ensued between our heroes and some dragonborn gladiators, 
                a spitting troll, and a handful of human thugs. An eidolon - a construct 
                guardian in service to the temple - <span class="future">confused by the 
                tortured Caretaker</span> worked against our heroes. Despite the odds, our 
                heroes were victorious.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking for the missing figure <span class="future">General Zithiruun</span> 
                our heroes opened the double doors at the top of the stairs. 
                For an eternal instant, the world faded away as they stood
                upon the precipice of infinity <span class="future">the Astral Sea</span>. An ocean of pearlescent
                silver stretched ever onward, its tides and crests all but
                invisible as they slowly traversed the great expanse. Beneath
                those waters, stars and constellations twinkled with almost
                blinding clarity, and far in the distance, the great peaks of
                an unknown isle protrude from the endless waters.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sense of vertigo there, at the edge of the world, was
                almost overwhelming, striking not merely at the body but at
                the mind and soul.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turning away from the double doors, the party searched the Reliquary, 
                picking through old tapestries, paintings, sculptures, books, and scrolls.
                Most of the artifacts had already been looted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They moved onto the separate building and its attachment. They were the only two structures
                in the cavern to have roofs, and were clearly of far more recent
                construction than most everything else therein. The walls
                were of thin stone and did not match the surroundings, and
                the floor was covered haphazardly with a thin rug. Several
                tables and chairs sat scattered about, and a cooking
                cauldron occupied one corner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apparently a sitting or study room, the chamber contained
                little but old, decaying chairs and a few small tables barely
                wide enough for a large tome.
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/The Caretaker.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                What was once a bedroom had been transformed into a
                chamber of horrors. Old blood had matted the carpet into
                a thin film that crunched beneath their feet. Dull blades
                and needles protruded from the surface of a desk, where they
                were apparently stuck for safekeeping. A wooden bed frame
                leaned against the wall at an angle; chained to it, dangling by
                his chafed and bloody wrists, was what appears to be a dwarf
                with hair and beard of writhing flame! Despite its touch,
                the wood of the frame showed no evidence of burning.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a panicked reaction, Kitara magically doused the flames - only for them 
                to reignite shortly thereafter as the dwarf turned out to be an azer - a 
                race of beings from the Elemental Chaos with fire for hair. Stunned by 
                having his hair put out, the Caretaker awoke from his torture-induced 
                unconsciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                While alive, the Caretaker appeared to have been driven mad by the tortures 
                inflicted upon him. With a combination of healing from Barases and Festivus 
                and gentle coaxing and preaching on the tenets of Moradin they slowly brought 
                the Caretaker back to himself.
                The azer blinked once, and when he looked at them again, his
        		eyes were clear - or rather, they appeared to burn with an inner
        		fire that they lacked earlier. He spoke in heavily accented
        		Common.

        			to be Moradin's will. I know not who these creatures were,
        			who invaded my home and dealt so cruelly with me, but I
        			know their intentions! I heard them plan! They seek to attack
        			the city of Overlook, from both without and - through my
        			temple - within! Even though the latter has been thwarted,
        			the former might yet lie ahead; Overlook, and indeed Elsir
        			Vale, might suffer greatly. But tell me, who are these villains?
        			Do you know? Tell me all that has happened, please...
        	    </p>
        	    <p>
        			I knew that the tall one wanted me to turn over
        			stewardship of the temple to him. I fear that, in

            <p>
            	Our heroes agreed to aid in reconsecrating the temple and spent 
            	precious time and residuum to do so. For just an instant, as the 
            	last echoes of the rite faded away,
        		the entire room grew ever so slightly warmer, as though
        		heated from within by the fires of a small forge. The faint
        		chime of hammers on steel reverberated from all around
        		our heroes, and then once more there was silence.
            </p>
            <p>
            	With the portals open, our heroes returned to Overlook through the door 
            	by which they had arrived at Mountainroot Temple and emerged back into 
            	the sepulcher in the Stone Anvil. Relating all that had transpired to 
            	High Ancestor Durkik, the priest took the Incunabulum Primeval from them 
            	with thanks and quickly ushered them out to meet a waiting squad of soldiers.
            </p>
            <p>
        		Durkik and the soldiers escorted our heroes through the streets of Overlook and the gates of the mighty
        		Caer Overlook, until finally they reached the imposing doors of the High Hall. Standing
        		on the dais in the center of the chamber were three of the
        		Council's five members, as well as several more soldiers and
        		High Priest Durkik Forgeheart.
        		Upon seeing our heroes, Great Elder Morgoff Stonefirst waved
        		at them, not to speak to them from below, but to join them
        		upon the dais!

            <p>
            	Without a moment to rest our heroes found themselves, along with the present members of the
        		council, High Priest Durkik, and several officers, standing in
        		a perfectly square room of stone walls. A table in the center of
        		the room boasted an intricate model of Overlook, while each of
        		the walls showcased maps of the surrounding area.
        		Great Elder Morgoff asked Durkik to offer a prayer to Moradin
        		to open the meeting. Once done, he said: 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
        		"I was hoping to wait until all our members were present, but we've still not heard
        		from Elders Itrika Mountainhome or Olman Sledgemore - 
        		they are, presumably, occupied with other duties and
        		our messengers haven't reached them to tell them of this
        		emergency conclave - and we've no more time to wait.
        		High Ancestor Durkik, as well as several other citizens,
        		such as Priestess Lavinya, have told us a bit of what's been
        		happening our city. But I'm given to understand that you
        		can tell us far more. Please, what's going on? Is Overlook
        		in danger?"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            	After our heroes related what they knew Morgoff continued:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
        		"Overlook is a
        		martial city. We have mighty walls, strong soldiers. But we
        		are accustomed to fighting foes such as orcs, not monstrous
        		enemies such as trolls, who rise again each time they fall. My
        		friends, you have more experience with such things. Will you
        		help us plan? And would you make yourselves available to us
        		throughout the siege, to deal with such dangers as our guards - 
        		skilled though they are - are unprepared to face? I offer you
        		what reward I can for your help, though I cannot cite you
        		numbers or amounts until I see what resources remain when - 
        		if - Overlook survives the coming days."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            	After long hours planning for the defense of Overlook and the 
            	coming attack Great Elder Morgoff's shoulders slumped. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
            	"I fear
        		we've done all we can for now. We must go
        		and spread word to our soldiers of what is to come,
        		and what they must do. My friends, if you are willing, I would have you stay here
        		at Caer Overlook tonight, so that you are ready on a
        		moment's notice. I can have people show you to guest
        		quarters. I suggest we all get a good night's sleep; I
        		fear the next days will be tiring indeed."
            </blockquote>
            <img src="places/The Sacrifice.png" class="left" />
            <p>
            	Lechonero went out scouting during the night and spied a mercenary army - 
            	consisting mostly of human soldiers and trolls, but with dragonborn and other creatures
        		scattered throughout - approaching Overlook from the south. Though he doubted his eyes at first, he 
            	also saw a flying ship sailing away in the opposite direction. He quickly returned to Overlook 
            	ahead of the army to warn the defenders and our heroes settled in for the night to wait.
            </p>
            <p>
            	They awoke in the morning to the sound of catapult boulders
        		slamming against the ramparts, and were swiftly summoned
        		to the Council's war room. 
            </p>
            <p>
        		Although the sentries fearfully reported a large force of trolls and other creatures
        		approaching the gates, the army sounded smaller than our heroes had feared.
        		Perhaps Zithiruun wasn't able to assemble as many troops as he’d hoped.
            </p>
            <p>
        		As they stood in the war room, discussing tactics, a
        		messenger barged in and dropped to one knee, panting, at
        		Great Elder Morgoff's feet.
        	</p>
        	<blockquote>
        		"My apologies for interrupting, but Nine
        		Bells is burning! A creature - gods, I've never seen anything
        		like them - they're flying over the district and dropping
        		alchemical fire bombs! The local soldiers are dealing with
        		some of them, but there are just too many!"
        	</blockquote>
            <img src="tactical/Death From Above.png" class="right" />
            <p>
        		As they raced through the city toward Nine Bells, our heroes noticed a
        		squad of soldiers standing victorious over a band of defeated trolls.
        		Durkik stood beside them, his hands flickering with holy fire.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Our heroes rushed to Nine Bells to intercede (especially worried that 
            	Amyria might be harmed as she prayed in the Temple of Ioun). When they 
            	arrived flames danced across a cluster of rooftops, and the crackling
        		from the fire drowned out the screams of panic as citizens
        		scrambled in all directions. In the smoky air above, a trio of
        		horrid winged humanoids, with mottled blue skin <span class="future">berbalangs</span>, whirled
        		about on the inferno-birthed updrafts. Every few moments,
        		one of them hurled a clay jug that burst into flames as it
        		struck a nearby building.
            </p>
            <p>
            	After shooting down the berbalangs and dealing with the spreading fire 
            	our heroes checked in on Amyria only to find her missing! They weren't 
            	afforded time to worry however, as a military courier caught up with them
            	and shouted:
            </p>
        	<blockquote>
        		"The outer wall! They've
        		breached the outer wall, just north of the west gate!"
        	</blockquote>
            <img src="tactical/Hold the Wall.png" class="left" />
            <p>
            	Hurrying down to the west gate our heroes arrived at a scene of destruction.
            	Rubble lay strewn about - rubble that used to be a 15-foot
        		stretch of wall. Visible just beyond was a huge tree trunk,
        		capped with bronze - presumably, the battering ram that
        		created the hole.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Moving through the gap were several hideous trolls. The
        		city guards appeared to have a few occupied, but others - two
        		in heavy armor, one with two heads, and one far smaller
        		than the others - were moving unimpeded into the streets.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Barely overcoming the powerful trolls, our heroes received no rest 
            	as without warning, they heard Great Elder Morgoff's voice in
        		their heads. 
            </p>
        	<blockquote>
        		"Our diviners have located Councilor Mountainhome.
        		A siege missile struck her home, which now burns as she
        		lies unconscious! Please save her!"
        	</blockquote>
        	<p>
        		Farther down the street, our heroes spotted a team of dwarves wearing the
        		holy hammer of Moradin. They were charging unharmed through a burning
        		building to reach a band of mercenaries threatening civilians. Standing
        		behind them, Durkik chanted passages from the Incunabulum Primeval.
        	</p>	
            <p>
            	Our heroes rushed to the Stonehammer district and found the 
            	expensive apartment of Counselor Itrika Mountainhome well 
            	and truly aflame. Climbing through upper-story windows and 
            	choking through the smoke Karrion and Kallista (naturally 
            	resistant to fire) found Itrika's recumbent form and carried 
            	her to safety.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Exhausted and drained our heroes retreated to High Hall to rest 
            	for the night as the battle continued to rage across the city.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Even as they rose from a night of troubled, martial dreams, a
        		knock sounded on their chamber doors. High Ancestor Durkik
        		stood outside, looking grim.
            </p>
        	<blockquote>
        		"I bring word from Councilor Morgoff. In the late
        		hours of the night, a squadron of soldiers was dispatched
        		to investigate reports of enemies in the streets close to Caer
        		Overlook. None have returned. As soon as you've risen and
        		readied yourself, I'm to show you on the map where they
        		were assigned, and ask you to investigate."

            <img src="tactical/General Zithiruun.png" class="right" />
            <p>
            	Arriving at the scene our heroes found the corpses of dozens of
        		Overlook's soldiers scattered around the open courtyard, and across the
        		stoops of the nearby buildings. Some were badly burned, some slashed
        		to ribbons, and some rotting as though they'd lain dead for
        		weeks on end. Two dragonborn in heavy armor waited across
        		the courtyard; one stood beside a large, red-scaled reptile <span class="future">Redspawn Firebelcher</span>
        		exhaling large puffs of smoke. Hiding amid the rubble and ruin was another
        		dragonborn, one of darker scales and armor, wielding a
        		pair of broad-bladed daggers.
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/General Zithiruun.png" class="left" />
            <p>
            	Shortly after engaging the mercenaries, a horrific boom reverberated from a nearby building as
        		a massive beast soared over the rooftop, knocking several
        		of the stones from their place. What appeared to be a dead
        		dragon <span class="future">Rathoraiax</span>, its scales dull, its gray leather skin showing between
        		the gaps, rose into the air on broken wings. The entire top
        		of its jaw was missing, showing upward pointing teeth and a
        		wormlike tongue that thrashed about with a mind of its own.
            </p>
            <p>
        		And riding atop that beast was a humanoid figure <span class="future">General Zithiruun</span> clad
        		in heavy hides, contained within a body harness of iron
        		joints and leather straps. His limbs and face were gaunt,
        		nearly desiccated. Several old wounds hung open, leaking
        		trails of blood and puss, showing bare bone in some spots
        		and metal plates in others. But despite his old injuries and
        		deformities, his narrow features and his yellowed, leathery
        		skin clearly marked him as one of the dread githyanki, raiders
        		and conquerors of the Astral Sea.
            </p>
            <p>
            	This was General Zithiruun. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	The battle raged between the buildings and across the rooftops - arrows and spells
            	exchanged for blasts of poisonous, necrotic gas from his reanimated mount Rathoraix.
            	Zithiruun appeared to glide rooftop to rooftop like a marionette <span class="future">telekinetic leaps</span> 
            	and tossing his silver saber to slash at our heroes before magically returning to his hand.
            </p>
            <p>
        		As things looked grim for our heroes, for just an instant, as they faced their enemies, they once again felt a faint
        		warmth, as of a forge fire, and heard the distant sound of chiming hammers. Their spirits soared with Moradin's blessing.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Though close to death, ultimately our heroes proved victorious. Once word of Zithiruun's death spread through
        		the invaders, their attack gradually weakened until
        		a cheer arose from the sentries atop the wall, as a force of several
        		hundred dwarves from Bordrin's Watch appeared on the western horizon, striking at the enemy
        		from behind and driving them back into the wild.
            </p>
            <p>
        		For the moment, our heroes had learned that the
        		githyanki are behind at least some of the troubles that
        		had beset Elsir Vale, and they could be content in the
        		knowledge that they had defeated one of their major
        		enemies and saved Overlook.
            </p>
            <p>
        		Lavinya abandoned the temple and instead took
        		over Haelyn's duties at the shrine.

            <blockquote>
        		"If this is where the
        		people wish to pray, then who am
        		I to tell them otherwise? Erathis needs no stone walls,
        		merely the hearts and souls of those who would bring
        		civilization and culture to the world. Haelyn understood
        		this long ago. I wish
        		I'd not taken so long to learn it myself."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
        		Durkik had experienced a reawakening
        		of faith. His time of confinement and torture,
        		followed by his rescue at the hands of our heroes and
        		his survival of the siege, had caused him to reevaluate
        		the previous years. From a beaten-down, tired,
        		and increasingly corrupt politician, he returned to his
        		younger identity as a devout priest of Moradin. In
        		helping to turn him around, our heroes had gained a
        		grateful and powerful ally, and they had done great
        		good to the religious community of Overlook as a
        		whole. This was particularly important, considering that
        		the high priests of other temples were suborned by
        		the githyanki, and their replacements were all younger
        		and inexperienced. Over the next months, Durkik
        		emerged as a spiritual leader for the entire city.
            </p>
            <p>
        		Overlook had weathered the storm,
        		and though damaged, the city stood tall and proud.
        		The Dusk Wardens were hailed as great heroes, and several different
        		establishments offered them free room and board
        		for several months. They were invited to dine with the Council of
        		Elders several times over the next few weeks.

                The summons from the Council of Elders was sudden
                and unannounced. 
                Once more, our heroes stood in the High Hall to be greeted by
                Overlook's elders, though their welcome was less brusque this
                time. Elder Cadrick addressed them as they

                    "Greetings, friends. We have received a desperate message from
                    Megan Swiftblade, leader of the Freeriders, who you might
                    remember. The Freeriders have discovered that General
                    Zithiruun had a powerful ally in his recent attack on the
                    city. Although she does not identify this ally in her message,
                    Megan has already survived three attempts on her life and
                    fears that more will follow. If we help her, she will tell us
                    who was ultimately behind the attack, hopefully in time to
                    prevent another.

                    out what Megan knows. Keep her safe, neutralize any
                    immediate threat to her, and then return her to us."

                Megan grew up in Talar, a small hamlet outside Brindol, and retreated 
                there for safety. She did not know who was behind the attempts on her 
                life but suspected it to be the ally of General Zithiruun she was 
                threatening to name. Her message to the council made no mention of where 
                she was staying, just that our heroes should leave a message for her at 
                the Green Dragon tavern.
        	</p>
        	<img src="npcs/Megan Swiftblade.png" class="right" />
        	<p>
                The council, concerned that the mysterious figure might
                still have designs on the city, dispatched our heroes to rescue
                Megan, eliminate any immediate threat to her safety, and
                return her to Overlook.
        	</p>
        	<p>
                The journey to Talar was long but not overly arduous. Just
                before dusk after a week of travel, our heroes arrived at the village's tavern and inn, the
                Green Dragon. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Green Dragon was a typical two-story village
                tavern and traveler's inn. Its outer walls were dressed
                stone, while internal walls and the floor were stout oak
                boards laid over thick joists. The roof was slate, and a
                small beer cellar was found under the common room.
                Inside and outside shutters kept the evening chill at
                bay.
            </p>
            <p>
                The common room took up the majority of the
                first floor, with a large fireplace opposite the bar filling
                the area with warmth and light. The walls were
                covered in faded tapestries showing hunting and
                woodland scenes. The second floor housed the inn's
                guests.
            </p>
            <p>
                Festivus spoke with Bernath - the innkeeper and a jovial, portly human widower - 
                and arranged an impromtu performance in exchange for room and board. At first 
                Bernath seemed uncomfortable with the idea but his 12-year-old son Niall, a devout 
                fan, changed his father's mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having secured rooms for the night and left
                their message, they took their rest in the dimly lit common
                room. Megan's message to the council stated that she would
                contact its emissaries only after making sure they had not
                been followed. With nothing left to do they sat back to slake their thirst and
                wait.
        	</p>
            <p>
                The majority of the patrons were human farmers relaxing after a hard day's work 
                in the field. Many were appreciative of the change of pace and left their small 
                groups to listen to Festivus.
            </p>
            <p>
                A frail cloth merchant by the name of Leucis, deep in his cups, convinced Kallisa to join
                him as a fellow tiefling (and alchoholic). He was a little too successful and Karrion 
                stepped in before he unloaded his wares on her.

                Lechonero spent the evening hitting on a heavily armed eladrin woman named Sariel who has 
                been sitting by herself. Though polite, she spurned all of his advances with a raised eyebrow.
            </p>
            <img src="places/The Green Dragon.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                Suddenly the tavern began to shudder violently as if in the grip of a
                powerful storm. Tipped tankards sloshed ale to the floor as several
                patrons were knocked back in their chairs. Window shutters
                banged wildly as the shaking increased, the floor and walls bucking
                as if alive. In panic, the other patrons staggered to their feet
                and attempted to flee the chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a horrendous cracking a ceiling beam was ripped free on the first floor. 
                Leucis was struck by the falling timber and tumbled to the floor, unconscious.
                Feeling guilty for dealing roughly with the man earlier, Karrion hoisted the merchant over her shoulder 
                and carried him to the door.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly thereafter the upper floor groaned ominously as its planks and timbers began
                to twist and splinter. The poorly distributed weight on the second floor caused a portion to cave in, 
                the impact tearing through the floor below and showering debris, Bernath, and a wobbly Kallista into 
                the cellar and burying one of the local farmers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, a particularly violent tremor shook the inn, hurling a
                shower of burning hot embers from the fireplace into the
                common room. A tapestry torn from the wall by a fleeing
                patron quickly began to smolder, but Kitara, now an old hand at fire fighting, quickly extinguished the flame.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tavern convulsed as more violent tremors struck. The
                great beams holding the upper floor aloft began to buckle
                ominously. Lechonero headed for the cellar stairs behind the bar while 
                Barases and Bin ushered farmers out the nearest windows.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aging timbers above our heroes' heads snapped like kindling.
                Then A shower of floorboards and furniture heralded the upper
                floor's collapse. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Nial, terrified by the events, huddled under a table while 
                the others fled. Barases tried to coax the boy from his hiding place, but his 
                visage only served to further terrify the boy. Switching tactics, he scared Nial 
                into the open and hauled him bodily outside.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bin struggled to haul debris off the buried villager and throwing his arm over 
                her shoulder carried the hobbled man out the nearby window.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lechonero heaved open the trapdoor to the cellar and pulled Bernath into a fireman's carry 
                and turned for the stairs, only to have Kallista stumble up ahead of him - saving a barrel 
                of whiskey from the destruction.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Flowing Death.png" class="right" />
            <p>
                Our heroes dived free with their wards in tow just before the doomed structure's final collapse - 
                only to be met with a worse sight: Flames leapt high in the air, silhouetting huddled survivors
                against the heaped mounds of rubble that were once their
                homes. Many of the buildings in the immediate vicinity
                had at least partially collapsed, and fires were spreading
                through the ruins. A terrified screaming rose in the
                distance along the main track - villagers were running toward
                them, a dark shape oozing down the street behind them.
            </p>
            <p>
                A viscous purple-red tide <span class="future">Blood Chaos</span> was flowing into Talar, pouring out
                from a low, craggy hill at the edge of the village. A tower
                of mottled stone stood atop the hill, the ooze flowing out
                through a hole blasted out beneath it. Where twin arms of
                the flow had circled a collapsed house, fire suddenly flared,
                trapping a terrified and heavily pregnant woman on an
                adjacent wagon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Worse still, horrific monsters resembling mounds of melting flesh writhed in the ooze. 
                A series of hulking creatures <span class="future">Chaos Maulers</span>, seemingly
                composed of congealed purple-orange liquid advanced with the tide on the helpless villagers. Their heads
                had no eyes or other features, and a single thick tentacle grew from their bellies. Among those 
                creatures flitted a couple paper-thin monsters <span class="future">Skulking Terrors</span> resembling headless, 
                flattened orange and purple bats. They dripped a viscous ichor in their wake from a number of
                small holes on their undersides. And worst of all, a couple giant undulating orbs of melting
                orange and purple flesh <span class="future">Scions of Chaos</span> writhed toward our heroes on a bed
                of muscular tentacles. Rings of larger tentacles jutted from the top of the orbs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lechonero jumped onto the wagon and carried the pregnant woman to safety while Karrion calmed the panicking 
                draft horses, freed them from the wagon and drove them clear of the burning tide. The monsters were closing in too 
                fast for our heroes to fight them off when another large wave of ooze swelled from under the tower and disgorged 
                a battered, burning ship. The capsized vessel rode the wave down the hill and balancing on the keel was - Melvin! 
                The boat flattened one of the giant orbs of tentacles as it ground to a halt and Melvin enacted his trademark 
                chaos, drawing off several of the monsters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Divided between two fronts, the monsters were no match for our heroes and were quickly dispatched. 
            </p>
            <img src="places/Flow Diagram.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                The horrid ooze continued to slowly flow through the
                village, destroying everything it touched. However, sudden
                movement atop the nearby hill caught our heroes' attention. Even
                as they watched, the mottled tower shuddered, then began to
                sink into the ground. Two frantic figures - one dragging the
                other - appeared on the rooftop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our heroes rushed to the tower as it continued to sink into the earth, 
                and by the time they reached the crest of the hill, only the roof and its
                battlements remained above ground. Two figures clung to the
                slate - one a human male dressed in sage's garb; the other a
                human female clad in armor, sword in hand. Though the
                male seemed utterly terrified, the woman was defiant despite
                what appeared to be a badly broken leg.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crossing the ooze on blocks that had fallen from the tower, 
                our heroes recognized Megan Swiftblade, leader of the
                Freeriders, even though she was badly injured and covered with dust. 
                The short-cropped blonde hair and the vicious scar running from her 
                forehead down her left cheek were a dead giveaway.
            </p>
            <p>
                She introduced her portly companion in a tattered and torn ink-stained robe 
                as Serten, apprentice to Falrinth - sage of the tower. The introductions were 
                cut short however, as both she and Serten asked our heroes to descend into the tower 
                to rescue Falrinth - still trapped inside. 
                Serten told our heroes how the earthquake had released several
                monsters kept by Falrinth for research purposes.
                Megan rescued him from these foul creatures, then
                he returned the favor by dragging her to the roof
                when a collapsing wall broke her leg. Both feared the monsters have Falrinth 
                trapped in the lower floors of the tower. 
            </p>
            <img src="places/The Mottled Tower.png" class="right" />
            <p>
                Agreeing to help, our heroes descended into the now subterranean tower.
                The earthquake and the tower's
                subsequent plunge into the hill had caused chaos
                within. Chairs and tables were overturned, while the
                contents of cupboards and shelves lay scattered upon
                the floor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The earthquake has caused
                extensive damage to the tower. Though the ancient
                structure was in no danger of collapse, sections of
                its walls had been badly weakened. Cracks had
                appeared above all the windows and doors, while
                stone dust and crumbled mortar covered the floor. Here
                and there, the massive stone blocks of the walls jutted
                inward from the pressure of the earth outside.    
            </p>
            <p>
                The first floor down was Serten's quarters. Three large cells stood along the walls of that gloomy
                chamber. All showed signs of extensive damage, their bars
                wrenched free and scattered across the floor. To the left,
                open double doors provided access to another area beyond.
                To the right, a pair of large insectoid creatures <span class="future">Mezzodemons</span> bearing a tridents
                lurked between the cells. At the sight of our heroes, they snarled and
                began to advance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The insectoid creatures were joined by a pair of neanderthal like humanoids <span class="future">Grimlock Ambushers</span> 
                and a toothed man covered in rolls of loose flesh <span class="future">Foulspan seer</span>. Our heroes were 
                forewarned however, and took the monsters with ease - though the floor creaked and bowing alarmingly,
                dust falling from above.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our heroes quickly descended through a level that served as a library, laboratory, and guest room; then one 
                with a master bedroom and banquet table; and finally to the first floor containing a kitchen, pantry, and storage. 
                Our heroes tiptoed around a jagged hole splitting the stone floor, flickering light welling up from a natural cavern below. 
                Shadows moved within the light, signs of something lurking deep beneath the tower.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kitara came across a magic orb belonging to Falrinth that she quickly pocketed before they discovered a portly human male 
                huddling within the devastation of the kitchen - Falrinth. His straggly brown hair was disheveled, mud staining
                his robes, but he was largely unhurt and only interested in the welfare of Serten and Megan.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Falrinth safely evacuated along with Serten and Megan, he told our heroes that he 
                had no knowledge of a cavern beneath the tower before the earthquake, but that he heard a ritual 
                being cast through the hole in his basement and assumed it must be the source of the ooze.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Blood Chaos Caverns.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                Proceeding back to the base of the tower our heroes dropped into the cavern to discover a gang of shadar-kai and 
                githyanki operating massive pipes disgorging the ooze and a witch in the process of casting a Linked Portal ritual. 
                It was a brutal combat, dancing between the pools of acidic ooze as spells flew back and forth. Despite a prolonged battle 
                with the witch, our heroes proved victorious and managed to close the floodgates spilling ooze from the pipes. The witch 
                never completed her Linked Portal ritual, but upon inspection Festivus determined it was being used as an escape route, 
                not a means to summon more of the ooze.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the immediate threat vanquished our heroes returned to interrogate Megan and Falrinth. Megan revealed that this was 
                the fourth assassination attempt made against her and that the rest of the Freeriders have retreated into hiding across 
                Elsir Vale. These attacks started after the Freeriders followed a band of mercenaries who escaped the siege of Overlook 
                and discovered they worked for Sarshan. Further investigation uncovered Sarshan's history providing mercenaries, 
                intelligence, support, and even arms and armor to the githyanki assault. Sarshan's insurance plan appeared to involve a 
                substance called Blood Chaos - the ooze that flooded Talar and some potential artificial concoction from the Elemental Chaos. 
                The Freeriders were discovered in their investigation, and even since Sarshan has been trying to wipe them out - first with 
                assassins and later trying to flood their hiding places throughout Elsir Vale with Blood Chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Falrinth identified the substance as Blood Chaos, and revealed that Elsir Vale is littered with hidden and secret portals - 
                allowing Sarshan to deliver his attacks to any part of the vale. When Festivus gave him the sigil sequence of the teleportation 
                circle the shadar-kai witch was attempting to open, he recognized it as a permanent circle in a fetid swamp far to the south known 
                to sages for its rampant primordial fauna and huge trees.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Draconic Wrath.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                After resting for the night, Festivus completes the witch's Linked Portal ritual and our heroes head through it in an attempt 
                to track the Blood Chaos back to its source - and Sarshan. As they shifted through the haze of the portal, they emerged
                on a wooden platform set upon the skeletal branch of an
                immense oak tree. The tree stands in the middle of a dismal,
                fog-shrouded swamp, the tree surrounded by a lake of blood
                chaos. Its huge roots snaked through the boiling ooze like
                great vipers, while above you, a thick canopy of leaves cut
                the light to a perpetual gloom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moments after stepping through the portal, our heroes were attacked by its guardians: the green dragons Antharosk and Calaunxin. 
                The mates strafed the party with their poisonous breath weapons and flyby attacks. With little room to maneuver, Kitara threw 
                up a Circle of Protection and the party turtled under the assault, gradually wearing the dragons down until they could effectively 
                go on the offensive. Ultimately the tide turned, our heroes drove the dragons back and ultimately to the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                Barases attempted to commune with the tree and nearly fell off the branches from the sheer size of the psyche he touched. 
                The Blood Chaos was eating away at the rest of the swamp but an ancient magic imbued the tree with a degree of protection from 
                its corrosive touch. Barases was unable to process much aside from the name of the plant - the Ever-Tree, that a winding 
                tunnel burrowed between the massive roots and deep into the ground on the other side of the trunk, and that the Blood Chaos 
                was seeping out from that tunnel. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The fetid tunnels beneath the Ever-Tree were a dark labyrinth, but our heroes had no time to lose. While the others guided
                the dazed Barases, Karrion lead the party through the twisting passages, blocking roots, past mudslides, cave-ins, and guards 
                and ultimately into an open cavern deep beneath the earth.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/In Fetid Darkness.png" class="right" />
            <img src="npcs/Sarshan.png" class="left" />
            <img src="npcs/Skull Lord Servitor.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                A pool of blood chaos and two teleportation circles
                dominated the chamber, and a horribly disfigured shadar-kai
                fled across a slender catwalk as they entered. Even as
                Sarshan disappeared into a misty haze that obscured the rear
                of the chamber, a three-headed skeletal figure <span class="future">Skull Lord Servitor</span> stepped out in
                front of our heroes. Several cyclops, a troglodyte <span class="future">Troglodyte Curse Chanter</span>, and a pair of armored wights
                <span class="future">Battle Wight Bodyguards</span> stood close behind it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sarshan's servants covered his retreat, trapping our heroes in close quarters combat. The Skull Lord Servitor lay about 
                on all sides with terrible magics - burning our heroes or sending them running in fear. And as each of the other undead 
                dropped, the Skull Lord Servitor would raise them back again. Barases and Oomoroo nearly died in the onslaught, but gradually 
                our heroes smashed his skulls, one by one, lessening his powers until he fell as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                With their enemies shattered, our heroes searched for Sarshan. The entire northern portion of
                the cavern was undercut by a buried permanent teleportation circle that acted as a portal to the Elemental Chaos.
                Festivus inspected the circle and surmised that strengthening magic had been applied to the portal. As such,
                activating the portal would not require a full Planar Portal ritual. However, Sarshan had magically locked the 
                portal as he fled. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Two other teleportation circles were carved into magically hardened mud in the floor,
                within which mystic sigils had been burned. The
                portals were inactive, but Festivus determined that they are designed to allow the
                flow of blood chaos to other locations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turning back to the original, Festivus worked to unlock the portal as our heroes searched the bodies of their foes. 
                Documents carried by the skull lord identified it as
                an envoy of Onthorirfel. Festivus recognized the name 
                as that of a powerful lich famed for his specialization in ritual magic who dwells in the Shadowfell.
                These documents also suggested that Sarshan
                and the lich had been collaborating on some plot,
                though no details were provided. Additionally, the skull 
                lord's ritual book contained the location of Sarshan's lair: the Tower of Djamela in the Elemental Chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
                The process of unlocking the portal would take hours, so our heroes lay down to rest from the battle.
            </p>

                The next morning Festivus cast the Linked Portal ritual on the mud-hardened portals and Lechonero stepped 
                through each quickly to scout the locations. One emerged on a hill overlooking Red Rock, and the other near 
                Dauth. Satisfied the locations held no immediate significance, Festivus finished unlocking the portal to the 
                Elemental Chaos and our heroes passed through it in pursuit of Sarshan.

            <p>
                A blast of heat heralded their arrival in the midst of
                an ocean of molten rock. Around the destination
                teleportation circle, numerous small islands floated on
                a burning sea like icebergs of rock and earth. These
                earthbergs drifted in proximity to a much larger island to
                the south. Tall dikes on this main island shielded it from the
                worst of the molten waves.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Sea of Fire.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                Through the heat haze, creatures were visible. A dwarf
                with coal-dark skin and blonde hair <span class="future">Duergar Hellcaller</span> was stationed on one
                of the earthbergs, while a large, wingless dragon <span class="future">Redspawn Firebelcher</span> guarded
                another. On the island, two githyanki stood with silver
                swords drawn. Close by, a red crystal <span class="future">Flame Shard</span> floated above the
                lava sea.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our heroes clashed with Sarshan's guards as the very earth beneath them shifted on a tide of fire. 
                The duergar used magic to push our heroes, many of whom came close to a deadly dip in the lava, but 
                thanks to Festivus and Karrion's newfound abilities to fly they avoided lethal burns. Pushing past 
                the opposition our heroes regrouped from their disparate earthbergs and marched on the Tower of 
                Djamela proper. 
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Galleries.png" class="right" />
            <p>
                The exterior of the 200-foot-high monolith tower was
                smooth-sided, polished obsidian. Its only entrance was a single gate that opened
                into the upper portion of an inverse gallery.    
            </p>
            <p>
                This cavernous chamber dropped 50 feet to a vast reservoir
                of seething blood chaos. A series of stepped ledges worked
                their way down the sides of the chamber, some connected
                by stairs, others by wooden ladders. Several ledges were
                decorated with statues. Straight across from the entrance
                and at the same level, a ledge contained the glowing sigils of
                a permanent teleportation circle.    
            </p>
            <p>
                The defenders of this chamber stood in wait - two
                humanoid fiends with leathery wings <span class="future">Storm Abishai Snipers</span>, another githyanki
                warrior, a centaur bearing a greatsword, and a demon
                ensconced in a rune-scribed shell <span class="future">Arctide Spiralith</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The defenders attempted to push the invaders into the blood chaos but our heroes 
                turned their tactics against them - Kitara knocked the centaur off the ledge and 
                into the burning ooze. She emerged on the lower levels and looked ready to rejoin 
                the fight despite her injuries when Barases confronted her - and using his standing 
                within the faerie courts demanded the fey warrior stand down. Reluctantly she did so - 
                agreeing to a cease fire but honor bound not to turn on her companions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly after the combat began
                a groaning roar suddenly shook the tower. The seething
                blood chaos below began to boil as a jet of magma shot
                into the reservoir through a wide-gaping crack in the
                wall. Foul-smelling steam vented upward as the level of the
                swirling pool began to rise.        
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Zereni Cyss.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                The centaur waited passively, if conflicted, at the gate while the party hopped from 
                ledge to ledge, chasing down the opposition while the Blood Chaos rose. When the combat had finished 
                the party was separated from the centaur by a room full of Blooad Chaos and magma. In the short 
                time before the room overflowed Barases questioned the centaur, shouting across the chamber.
            </p>
            <p>
                She introduced herself as Zereni Cyss, a fey warrior in service to Sarshan. Barases questioned how 
                an honorable centaur warrior could find herself in service to a scoundrel like Sarshan.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "I once held rank and honor in the Seelie court. Like you lord, I upheld the light and warmth of Summer. Then I followed the wrong orders and now I am bound in darkness like him."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                she answered sadly. Barases asked if she had seen his brother, and she answered:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "No one has seen Petraynus in the last five years. I fear he is lost to us."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                As the Blood Chaos threatened the ledge upon which she stood Barases bid Zereni Cyss 
                farewell and she fled out across the grounds ahead of the flood. Then our heroes 
                stepped into the teleportation circle and vanished as well.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Crusher Rooms.png" class="right" />
            <p>
                Our heroes arrived in an L-shaped chamber that was bare stone except for the glowing
                sigils of the permanent teleportation circle within which
                they stood. The chamber was divided into three subchambers,
                each set 5 feet below the previous, but the far end of the last
                section could not be seen around the corner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kallista's sharp eyes noted scratches that marred the floor and ceiling, as if the
                walls had moved inward at some point, then back out. She had only enough time to 
                shout "Trap!" before a grinding of stone on stone prompted the walls of the
                subchamber to lurch forward. At the same time, two ghostly
                forms <span class="future">a Wailing Ghost (Banshee) and a Lingering Specter</span> 
                shot up from beneath the floorboards to attack, followed by the hulking form of 
                a flesh golem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though the flesh golem tried to pin our heroes in the trap, Festivus used some of her 
                fae bard tricks to swap positions with the golem and usher her companions quickly past it's 
                lumbering form to make a dash for the double-doors at the far end of the room.
            </p>
            <p>
                The double-doors were locked, and Kallista spent several hurried seconds with the 
                mechanism as the walls closed in and the golem struggled to chase them. She popped 
                the lock and several party members dashed through. In their haste to escape the trap 
                our heroes failed to notice that the double doors led into a space the size of a closet - 
                but each one that passed through the doors suddenly disappeared.
            </p>
            <img src="tactical/Sarshan.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                When they passed through the doorway they were teleported to a circle on the roof of the tower.
                The top of the tower was guarded by eight warrior githyanki,
                all bearing silver greatswords. Their leader wielded a sliver
                longsword, his eyes flashing with mystic power. On the far
                side of a tower, a sphere of translucent force protected three
                figures: Sarshan and two shadar-kai bodyguards. However,
                the scars that the arms dealer bore when our heroes saw him
                in Umbraforge paled in comparison to his current state.
                The shadar-kai's skin seethed and bubbled as tendrils of
                blood chaos erupt from open sores on his face and hands.
                Within the protective force sphere, he worked intently over a
                teleportation circle, attempting to activate its power.
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Sarshan.png" class="right" />
            <p>
                Festivus identified the teleportation circle as having been prepared for
                a Linked Portal ritual - one that Sarshan was only minutes
                away from completing.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first Sarshan contemptuously ignored our heroes, continuing his ritual 
                casting as his githyanki lackeys closed in on them. Kitara threw up another 
                Circle of Protection as the enemies surrounded them. Our heroes cut the melee 
                short by successfully pitching several of the githyanki off the roof of the tower 
                to the layer of magma and blood chaos pooling in the courtyard 200 feet below.
            </p>
            <p>
                With no one left to stop them Sarshan diverted his attention just long enough 
                to dispatch his personal bodyguards out from under the force shield to confront 
                our heroes. The shadar-kai were better prepared, evading any fatal falls, but were 
                unable to overcome our heroes' defenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alone on the roof with Sarshan our heroes started attacking the force shield in an 
                attempt to reach Sarshan himself. Though the shield held, it began to crack. Seeing 
                that he would not complete the ritual in time to escape, Sarshan abandoned the 
                casting in disgust, turning to face his attackers directly. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "You ignorant, ungrateful children! You dare attack me? After I saved you in the
                tunnels? After I spared you in Umbraforge? I care not who you are, I'll show you no such mercy now!"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                With a flick of his arm, a flare of Blood Chaos sprayed from the sores along his skin, 
                enveloping our heroes and pushing them back from the force shield. Emerging from the 
                shield, Sarshan appeared to fade into shadow while the Blood Chaos within him glowed 
                even brighter as if he were a shell around a flame. He moved too quickly to follow, 
                appearing directly beside his targets, his inky katars slashing our heroes in a flurry before 
                he teleported on to the next victim.
            </p>
            <p>
                The vicious assault of his blades peppered with sprays of Blood Chaos that continued to 
                burn after he moved on forced our heroes to retreat to Kitara's Circle of Protection and 
                exchange blows as Sarshan appeared around them to attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                While his assault was a frenzy, Sarshan proved unable to deal significant enough a blow to 
                truly overcome Kitara's protection and the battle began to turn against the shadar-kai. He was 
                no fool, and as he came to understand his fate he grew more vicious and angry. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "A faithful servant all these years and now this? Brought down by insects? If I am to fall, then 
                let it be for a reason!"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Sarshan then began to focus all his might on Barases alone. While his aimed fury hurt Barases badly, 
                Festivus and Bin's magical healing kept him standing as Sarshan began to wane.
            </p>
            <p>
                As our heroes delt Sarshan a felling blow, his eyes seemed to flare with the inner fire of the Blood Chaos 
                as he spit his final curse:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Sangwyr take you!"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                As Sarshan died the ground began to shudder and list as the Blood Chaos swamped and consumed the Tower of Djamela.
                The teleportation circle they arrived in was of no help - locked into returning to interior the tower. Only 
                Sarshan's partially completed circle gave any promise of escape. Frantically our heroes dismantled what remained of the
                force shield and Festivus set to work configuring the portal to return to the interplanar portal on the earthberg 
                through which they arrived in the Elemental Chaos - her magic limited to portal travel only within the plane. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As she worked feverishly, the tower wobbling and bobbing beneath them, our heroes searched Sarshan's belongings.
                Aside from a chest of treasure they found copious writings. 
                His notes and journals indicated he fled to the Elemental Chaos after the fall of his fortress at Umbraforge, 
                discovering Djamela's island during his travels. After saving the island from the raging lava sea, the shadar-kai 
                found fragments of the old efreet mage's work, and soon had completed her dangerous research on Blood Chaos. He 
                then weaponized the substance and used his portal network to attack the Freeriders and Elsir Vale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just before the tower fell into the Sea of Fire Festivus completed the ritual and our heroes escaped to the now distant 
                earthberg in time to see the obsidian spire sink beneath the magma waves. They returned through the portal to the Ever-Tree 
                and after recovering from their injuries, returned via portal to Talar to collect Megan Swiftblade and begin the journey back 
                to Overlook.

        	<h2>Current adventure</h2>
        	<p>
                Back in Overlook, our heroes had several weeks to relax and aid in 
                the reconstruction of Overlook. One day after this respite our heroes 
                were interrupted by an exhausted, panting soldier from Overlook's city 
                militia. The soldier, a human named Coggin, had been sprinting through 
                the city along with nearly twenty other Overlook soldiers trying to find 
                them. Between gasps for breath, the overwhelmed (and slightly star-struck) 
                guard told them why he has been sent:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "My name's Coggin, sirs. I was sent to find you. The guard
                captain asked that you report immediately to the West
                Gate. One of our scouts to the south reported that there's
                some sort of a flying warship headed for the city. It's armed,
                and it isn't built by any race they recognized. After how
                you've helped the city so much, the captain would like you
                on hand in case there's trouble. Sirs."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Our heroes rushed through the streets to the West Gate, lead by Coggin and 
                joined by a growing escort of soldiers as they ran. They were waved quickly 
                through several checkpoints before reaching the walls. Before they gained a
                vantage point beyond the city they heard a loud scraping and creaking noise, 
                like the sound of heavy wooden timbers being dragged roughly across the ground. 
        	</p>
        	<img src="places/The Sacrifice.png" class="left" />
        	<p>
                When our heroes reached a point that overlooked the west
                and southwest of the city, they saw that a flying galleon
                <span class="future">named the Conqueror and belonging to the githyanki</span> had ignominiously crashed
                into the war-torn turf beyond the city. The mast had
                an improvised white flag hanging limply from it. The
                galleon had skidded to a halt on the ground, and the
                ship looked to have already been in a war. Patches of the
                vessel had been charred by intense <span class="future">red dragon</span> fire, with other
                sections badly damaged as if struck by large weapons.
        	</p>
        	<p>
                Two lone humanoid figures were visible on board, waiting
                by the rail. Citizens outside the city were fleeing from
                the wreck as quickly as possible, and our heroes
                could hear their screams easily from the wall. Every guard
                nearby had a crossbow trained on the passengers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The (clearly rattled) local guard captain - a
                female human named Captain Jerra Dauralis - asked
                our heroes to accompany her down to speak with the ship.
                It took only a few minutes to descend the steps and
                exit the city's gate.
            </p>
            <p>
                The warship leaned to one side, and it had clearly been in a
                fight. Its sails were ragged, and the stern of the ship was charred
                from intense fire. A humanoid with greenish skin and gray
                robes stood by the rail <span class="future">Tokk'it</span>, hands held open, 
                waiting for our heroes to approach. 
                Closer to the ship, the other passenger is visibly exhausted and anxious, 
                but just as clearly recognizable as Melvin. Breaking into a broad grin he saluted 
                his old companions:

                    I know I disappeared on you back in 
                    Fortress Graystone, and for that I appologize. I was summoned to the aid of my missing master Marduk Goldbludgeon
                    via the psychic network linked to that ancient githzerai stronghold. He attempted to use it 
                    to pull me through the Elemental Chaos to him at a similar githzerai fortress called Akma'ad where he and 
                    other members of our monastic order were under attack by their mortal enemy: the githyanki. However, a 
                    covert attack by the githyanki during my transit severed my connection to my master and left me stranded 
                    in the Elemental Chaos. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There I met Tokk'it and after a long journey to together we returned to what passes for civilization on that 
                    plane. We alerted the other githzerai in their city of Zerthadlun to the attacks and the damage to their 
                    psychic network. With their help we managed to repair it long enough to send some reinforcements to Akma'ad, 
                    including the two of us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our reinforcements were insufficient however, as during our long travels githyanki reinforcements arrived to 
                    swell the ranks of the sieging army. I gather you've seen them here as well. The tide was quickly turning against 
                    my brethren so in a desperate gambit a squad of us snuck through the siege lines, slew this ship's captain and commandeered the 
                    vessel from the enemy to escape and seek aid from you here. We managed to disable another ship before we got away. 
                    We were chased and attacked by githyanki lancers riding red dragons but we were able to outpace them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Akma'ad is some 140 miles southwest of here, about a day's journey in this tub if we can fly her properly. 
                    I don't know the exact numbers of the enemy, but I saw three war galleons like this one here and at least three 
                    lancers, so I'd guess two or three hundred. There were nearly 100 trained monks at Akma'ad and several dozen non-combatants.
                    We need to return with help before the githyanki breach our fortress and exterminate my brethren. 
                    Please, time is short and we must hurry."

                Captain Dauralis, silent up to this point, suggested that the Council would not approve depleting the troops from 
                Overlook in the wake of General Zithiruun's invasion. Instead our heroes used their contacts to recruit a small force 
                of mercenaries to aid them while the city made the ship flight worthy again. In less than an hour our heroes were aboard 
                with small rescue force as the newly christened "Holy Cow" took to the air.

            <p>
                Tokk'it led our heroes to the bridge - a relatively bare room, boasting a runic
                circle on the floor and a ship's wheel standing before
                it. Windows around the room allowed the captain to
                see forward and arrowslits allowed spellcasters to target
                attackers to port or starboard outside the ship.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dead githyanki captain's body lay in a heap on
                the side of the room. The rear of the bridge featured a
                heavy tapestry giving glory to a tall githyanki knight
                standing triumphantly before a throne.        
            </p>
            <p>
                Tokk'it stood in the ritual circle, taking the wheel and concentrating. As he did so disembodied moans 
                and screams started to echo about the ship as the psychic echoes of possessed githyanki sailors manifested as translucent shimmers 
                to man the rigging. Tokk'it explained that this was normal - if a typically despicable piece of githyanki magic. When some of our 
                heroes began to confuse githyanki with githzerai Tokk'it was quick to elucidate them on the distinctions - at length.    
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "The githzerai and the githyanki were once one people in the ancient past, enslaved by the mind flayers. After countless 
                    generations of brutal oppression, our people developed some of the psionic powers of their masters until one day the hero Gith 
                    arose to lead us to freedom and break the illithid empire.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    However, once her people were free she went too far. She launched a crusade to exterminate every last one of the 
                    mind flayers, turning the former slaves into a conquering army rather than a free people. Thus the githyanki - 'the children of Gith' 
                    were born.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    A great mind, Zerthimon, spoke out against Gith replacing one tyranny with another, demanding she step down. She refused and a civil war 
                    followed that nearly destroyed us all. Ultimately Zerthimon defeated Gith in single combat, and in his wisdom showed her the way of peace 
                    and spared her life. He exiled her and her followers to the Astral Sea where they became little better than bloodthirsty pirates. 
                    Zerthimon claimed the Elemental Chaos for his people - my people - the githzerai: 'those who spurn Gith.' 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    To confuse githzerai with githyanki is an insult. Do not make the mistake again." 
                </p>

            <p>
                Tokk'it went on to admit that he doesn't fit in well with other githzerai. He had been rebuked by his elders for a lack of emotional control 
                and disordered thinking. He found some acceptance with the female Gallia while they were romantically involved, but she broke up with him 
                several months ago, and he hoped that proving himself a hero with this rescue mission might lead to a reconciliation.

                Elsewhere onboard, Melvin explained how important this mission was:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "This githyanki attack could not have come at a worse time.
                    Most of the githzerai at Akma'ad right now are visitors. The
                    abbot is hosting a meeting of extremely important religious
                    and political leaders. Kath'ik from the Monastery of Nine
                    Stones, Most Exalted Odos from the House of Reprisal,
                    Wellik the Elder from the Tower of Dancing Flame ... all
                    leaders that the githzerai look up to. I think they are deciding
                    who will lead them in the upcoming war, and how involved they
                    will be in aiding our world."

                Kitara headed belowdecks to search the ship. Picking the lock to the captain's cabin, she found documents identifying the vessel as the 
                Conqueror and the deceased captain as one Captain Dav'ot. The ship's manifest listed a full contingent of 140 troops, one dragon and one 
                lancer, and a gish assassin named Brann'ot. There were orders signed by a Captain Iquel ordering the Conqueror to accompany the Sacrifice 
                and the Tyranny from Tu'narath to attack the githzerai stronghold of Akma'ad:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Dav'ot,
                <p>
                    We expect the attack to go smoothly and quickly.
                    Our informer is inside Akma'ad already, and has
                    agreed to assist Brann'ot in the assassination of the
                    foul githzerai leaders. Once you receive the signal
                    from my flagship that the defenses are neutralized,
                    land the Conqueror at a safe distance from the
                    fortress and disembark all of your troops along with
                    the Tyranny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the grace of High Emperor Zetch'r'r, Lord of the
                    Astral Sea,

                In the first officer's cabin Kitara found three small, hand-drawn portaits of githzerai 
                <span class="future">Odos, Kath'ik, and Wellik - the githzerai leaders then meeting in Akma'ad</span>.

                Less than an hour after our heroes departed Overlook
                on the damaged galleon, it sailed through wispy clouds. 
                Suddenly, Lechonero spotted movement ahead from his perch in 
                the crow's nest. Two red shapes flew out of a
                cloud, changing direction and speeding up as they moved in
                our heroes' direction. Lechonero saw two red dragons, each with a rider
                strapped on its back, and called the crew to arms, manning the ballistae 
                on deck.
            </p>
            <img src="places/The Conqueror.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                The highly maneuverable dragons strafed the Holy Cow with their firey breath, allowing the lancers 
                to make charging swipes at the defenders on deck and be away before they could fight back, but 
                Lechonero's keen aim whittled the dragons down and kept them from lining up ideal strikes against 
                the ship. Combined with an assault by the mercenaries manning the ballistae and coordinated by Barases, 
                the dragons were slain, forcing the lancers to glide unnaturally through the air to land on the deck 
                and engage our heroes in melee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just as our heroes dispatched the githyanki Lechonero called out from the crow's nest again. 
                The red dragon closing on the ship was larger than the two
                they just fought. There was one scarred githyanki riding it. This veteran dragonknight proved more 
                strategic then his compatriots - attacking Lechonero directly to disable our heroes' best ranged 
                attacks and staying out of the firing arcs of the ballistae. Still, Lechonero proved the more resilient, 
                forcing the dragonknight to the deck where the rest of our heroes dealt with him handily.
            </p>
            <img src="places/Akma'ad.png" class="right" />
            <img src="tactical/Akma'ad.png" class="left" /
            <p>
                Our heroes passed over fields and woods that gradually
                give way to a reddish rocky waste as they approached
                the githzerai fortress. They saw signs of the battle before
                they saw Akma'ad itself; fire and smoke rose from the site
                in a dark pillar. The Holy Cow crested a final mountain range and saw Akma'ad below.
                The fortress was utilitarian and stark, with
                red walls rising up over a dusty valley. An overhanging
                mountain cave amde it extremely defensible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Akma'ad was surrounded by githyanki troops and a vessel 
                identical to their own approaching them, troops moving on its deck. From the lettering on the gunwale, Lechonero 
                identified it as the Sacrifice. Melvin rushed to the pilot's cabin and took the helm from Tokk'it. The two ships 
                jockeyed for position, the ballista shots from each going wide. Barases organized a boarding party among the 
                mercenaries - readying grappling hooks to bind the ships on their next pass. Once again they failed to ram 
                one another upon their bow spikes, but Barases' grappling team caught the gunwales of the Sacrifice from a higher 
                angle. The mercenaries brought the ships side by side, the Holy Cow hull resting on the edge of the Sacrifice's deck 
                and Barases, Kallista, Kitara, and Karrion jumped dow to board the enemy ship.
            </p>
            <p>
                Helpless against the grapples and as the boarding party cut through her troops, Captain Iquel made good on her ship's 
                namesake and steered her into the Holy Cow's hull, scraping it's keel across her own deck, destroying her sails and 
                scattering the melee to deadly effect. Bereft of it's rigging, the Sacrifice lost its flight magic and hung as a dead 
                weight from the grapple lines - causing the tied ships to begin a death spiral toward Akma'ad below. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lechonero attempted to join the melee by leaping from the Holy Cow's crow nest to the rigging, only to have it 
                collapse under him and tumble gracelessly 40 feet to the deck of the Sacrifice below.
                When Captain Iquel emerged from the helm and laid about her with magic Kitara answered in kind - the two wizard swordswomen 
                swashbuckling across the heavily listing deck as bits of rigging from both ships fell about them. In the end Kitara brought 
                Iquel to her knees and battered her across the deck and with a final magically-enhanced kick booted her off the gunwale to plummet 
                to the ground far below.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unable to prevent their eventual crash, Barases evacuated everyone back to the Holy Cow and strategically cut the grapple lines 
                to drop the Sacrifice onto a force of githyanki on the ground. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the way down, it was clear that two squat guard towers perched
                on top of the steep cliff containing Akma'ad. Chains were stretched between them,
                holding back what must have been hundreds of tons of rock and
                rubble. Several githyanki were guarding the towers.
                Melvin managed to steer the Holy Cow into a rough landing against the 
                towers. Quickly disembarking our heroes overwhelmed the githyanki squad guarding the clifftop and released 
                Akma'ad's landslide defense on the army below.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a tremendous, deafening roar, a cascade of rock - from
                pebbles the size of a pea to boulders the size of a mule -
                tumbled down onto the githyanki army massed outside the
                walls of Akma'ad. At first, all our heroes saw was a blinding cloud of
                dust, but as the wind cleared it from the field, they saw that
                hundreds of githyanki troops had been pulverized by the
                rock, and the rest were scattered or fleeing outright.
            </p>
            <p>
                Karrion teleported the party into the midst of the remaining githyanki hugging the walls 
                of the fortress while Lechonero sniped dangling from the chains that formerly restrained the landslide. 
                Taken by surprise, our heroes wiped out the stragglers and were taken into Akma'ad by its defenders who 
                had been holding a breach in the wall. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The githzerai had suffered serious loses since Melvin's last count. Only about 50 fighting githzerai 
                still survived, including Tokkit's Gallia.  
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Odos.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                The surviving githzerai, many of them wounded, gathered
                around an old blind githzerai who seemed as aware of his
                surroundings as if he could still see. The monk spoke in a
                rough tone. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "We're alive. I don't know how they knew we
                were here, but the cost was high. Too high. Both Kath'ik
                and Wellik are dead, along with dozens of our brothers and
                sisters. We lost the abbot and most of the monastery. Our
                conference is finished. Now I must decide our path." 
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                With an almost undetectable grimace, the stoic
                githzerai turned his empty eye sockets toward the lines
                of dead and wounded. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Gather your belongings. In the
                morning we travel to Sayre. There is a conference there
                I am obligated to attend before we depart for home." 
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                He paused and turned his sightless gaze in our heroes' direction. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "You aren't githzerai, but you fought for us. Who are you?"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Tokk'it introduced our heroes and explained their
                role in the battle. Most of the githzerai hailed them as heroes,
                and Odos (the blind githerzai) grudgingly thanked them,
                but he was exhausted and grieving for his slain friends and 
                came across as dour, pessimistic, and suspicious. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In speaking with Odos, our heroes discover 
                that he was concerned greatly about
                his people and their future. He worried that Sayre was only a
                temporary solution, and doesn't know if there's anyone he
                or the githzerai can trust other than themselves. Odos was a
                good and just leader, and his taciturn nature was a reflection
                of the hardships his race has endured, exacerbated by the
                recent attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                He reveals that the githyanki attacked without
                warning, and they sent strike teams to the personal
                chambers of all the githzerai leaders, as if they knew exactly
                who to attack and where they were staying. He was convinced
                someone fed them information on the layout of Akma'ad,
                as well as the names of the leaders present. Odos himself was spared
                only because he stepped outside for a walk and heard the
                team of assassins in his room on his way back. He surprised
                the squad of three and defeated them single-handedly.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the githyanki assassins
                in his room had a small device that could be held in her
                hand. She was speaking into this object when he surprised
                the assassins in his room. It was green and looked reflective.
                Festivus inspected the shard of green glass, identifying it as 
                some type of magically one-way communication device, allowing the 
                carrier to transmit a message through some unknown ritual.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apparently attacks of this sort had been
                happening to githzerai enclaves and monasteries all over
                the mortal realm. Most had fled to a refuge in Sayre, a
                nearby city. Odos wanted to take his people there after the battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Odos and the other githzerai had planned this
                meeting at Akma'ad to discuss whether or not to accept an
                invitation in Sayre to meet with a newly formed coalition
                of leaders from other regions of the world concerned with
                the extent of the githyanki invasion. Each comes from a
                homeland ravaged by the githyanki, and they're all looking
                for aid and support from their regions. Odos was bitter that
                the "humans" (he has a tendency to call all non-githzerai
                and non-githyanki "humans") sound divided over political
                issues when there's so much at stake. He was against going
                to the meeting, but after the battle felt that going to Sayre was the only
                choice for his people.    
            </p>
            <p>
                Tokk'it sought out Gallia to introduce her to our heroes. In the process of
                seeking her out, Tokk'it spoke with other githzerai,
                many of whom remark how they believed she was
                dead because she was trapped on the upper roof and surrounded.
                When Tokk'it found her, he is overjoyed she is alive, but she 
                acted coldly toward him and shrugged off
                any questions about the battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Tokk'it introduced Gallia to Karrion, she was polite but formal and quickly 
                excused herself. Tokk'it was upset and Karrion attempted to console him with 
                platitudes before awkwardly excusing herself as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sayre was over twenty miles away across rough terrain,
                and the githzerai had wounded who had to be
                pulled along in small carts. Due to the slow pace, it
                took two days for the githzerai to reach Sayre with
                their patients. Under the ministrations of Festivus and Barases and
                any githzerai healers, the injured troops began to heal.
            </p>
            <p>
                One the first night of the journey, the githzerai camp was quiet. 
                Even the wounded seemed to have found some peace in the wilderness. 
                Suddenly the peace was shattered as a commotion at the edge of the camp turned into an a series of 
                hit-and-run attacks. Kitara and Barases chased the assailants into the woods.
                Once they were out of sight a githyanki emerged straight out of the
                ground at Lechonero and Festivus' feet, a silvery longsword poised to strike.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a lengthy pursuit Barases and Kitara abandoned the chase and turned to 
                return to camp only to be ambushed by their prey - aided by a masked female 
                githzerai. They defeated the ambush, but the masked githzerai disappeared into 
                the woods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lechonero and Festivus were pinned down by the gish assassin Brann'ot - a vicious melee 
                fighter who put the two ranged combatants at a severe disadvantage. Ultimately they 
                managed to spread out and encircle him, between their arrows and spells limiting his 
                movement until they could whittle him down.
            </p>

            <p>
                Licking their wounds the band continued on to the city of Sayre. After several days travel 
                they descended from the mountains and found themselves on the fertile floodplain surrounding the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                They made a leisurely journey around the Lake of Songs - dammed at its outflow and used year-round for
                fishing and recreation; its beauty a work of art. They followed the Singing River as it descended from 
                the lake past bucolic farmlands and for the first time in weeks began to feel themselves relax. 
            </p>
            <img src="maps/Sayre.png" class="right" />
            <p>
                During the journey Festivus regailed her companions with tales of her years studying
                the Arts at the famed University of Sayre. She had run away from her home in Sherrbyr, 
                fleeing the repressive society of her youth. Seeking a more accepting culture 
                she came to this flamboyant metropolis which valued beauty and knowledge over religion.
            </p>
            <p>
                They heard the distant sound of church bells long before they
                actually saw Sayre. It lay in the valley below them, nestled
                between three rivers. Sunlight reflected from the city's canals.
                Although it had roughly the same number of inhabitants as
                Overlook, Sayre was a very different city. It was said to be a city
                of artists, artisans, and scholars, and one can see why. The
                sunlight filtering through the hills gave a golden glow to the
                entire valley. From where they stood, they could see mansions and
                palaces rising up from islands between the rivers, university
                halls jutting upward, numerous monuments and large statues,
                and the smoke from smithies rising into the air. Mist from a
                huge waterfall swirled along the southern edge of the city.
            </p>
            <img src="places/Sayre/Overview.jpg" class="left" data-slides="places/Sayre/Overview.jpg,places/Sayre/Entry bridge.jpg,places/Sayre/Gatehouse.jpg" />
            <p>
                A guardhouse stood in front of the great bridge that
                lead over the river into the city. A throng of people bustled
                about - buskers, salesfolk, travelers, beggars, and guards.
                Even a few rich nobles could be seen, riding in open-top
                carriages in their finery.
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Pennel.jpg" class="right" />
            <p>
                A servant approached our heroes, haltingly. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Excuse me, but by any chance are you the Heroes of Elsir Vale?"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                When they confirmed their not-so-humble identities the man continued:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "My master will be so pleased! You're quite famous; he was
                just talking about you today at tea. Would you do me the
                honor of allowing me to introduce you?"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Given permission, he looked even
                happier and lead them through the throng to a darkdoored
                wooden carriage with remarkable stained
                glass windows. The carriage was pulled by two horses.
                The servant knocked once and opened the door.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "My Lord Telicanthus, may I please introduce the famous Heroes of Elsir Vale."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                A tall, spindly man stepped out into the sunlight. Lord
                Telicanthus was a githyanki.
            </p>
            <img src="npcs/Telicanthus.png" class="left" />
            <p>
                Fresh from their near-deadly encounter with Brann'ot, Lechonero had a near-violent
                reaction to the newcomer, warning "Githyanki!"
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Of course I am! I'm not associated at all with those
                murderous fellows in the Astral Sea, though. No, I left
                that life years ago and I've never regretted it once. I'm a
                glassmaker now, and a loyal citizen of this fine city. We
                can't help how we're born, but we can choose how we live
                our lives. Something that everyone really ought to learn."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                He was quite unlike any githyanki that our heroes had
                seen before, however. Lord Telicanthus had a warm,
                quick smile and eyes that make it clear he was very
                interested in whomever was speaking. He wore very
                fashionable, expensive clothing and had no githyanki
                jewelry or weaponry whatsoever. His handshake was
                firm, his voice clear, and he had only the faintest
                trace of an accent when he addresses the group:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "It's such a pleasure to meet you. We've received some news
                of our friends to the north, but I never expected to meet the
                heroes in person! Some travelers have brought word of your
                many battles. It's very rare to meet living heroes, so this is
                quite a moment for me. Are you just arriving here in Sayre?"
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                "Well, allow me to provide you with some most humble
                shelter! The finest inn in the city is the River Jewel, right by
                the bridge in our Glassworks District. Pennel?"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                he turned to his secretary, just exiting the carriage.    
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Run ahead to the Jewel and book... [counting the group] Rooms for
                each of them. Put it on my account there, meals included.
                Let them know that their guests are people of honor, and
                are to be treated as such. It's so rare to get people of the world here, artists aside...
                Would you do me the honor of coming to tea
                tomorrow? All the elite in the city, from the mayor on down,
                would doubtlessly be honored to meet you. You'll be the toast
                of the town. Tomorrow, at my estate - I'll have Pennel leave
                details for you in the morning, and I'll send a carriage."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                After Telicanthus' carriage departed, our heroes found that the guards 
                had refused to let their Githzerai companions
                cross the bridge into the city.
