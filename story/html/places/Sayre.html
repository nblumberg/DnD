                Sayre is an artistic, monument-filled city built in a particularly
                beautiful valley. Sayre holds a university and
                a large number of artisans, making it a popular site for
                those who deal in either information or fine art.

                <h5>Population:</h5>
                Approximately 12,000, including
                almost 1,500 students attending the University. Most
                inhabitants are human, elf, eladrin, or halfling. Some
                dwarves also live in Sayre, although they tend to keep
                to themselves.

            <div class="fullpage">
                <h5>Government:</h5>
                Sayre is governed by Lord Divian
                Torrance, a politically astute nobleman adept at playing
                different factions of the city against each other.
                Power resides with Lord Torrance, as well as the Artisan's
                Guild and the University's archdean.

            <div class="fullpage">
                <h5>Defense:</h5>
                The Guards of the March are a force of
                100 soldiers led by General Alvro Taramin that have
                little to do other than patrol the safer sections in and
                around the city. Most merchants, guilds, and noble
                families have their own mercenary guards that protect
                their property and work together when danger
                appears. In a time of crisis, General Taramin has the
                authority to call on any house with its own private
                guard to cede command of their troops directly to
                him. Fortunately, he has never had to do so, but if he
                were, he could call over 2,000 troops. With a cliff, a
                lake, and steep hills protecting three sides of Sayre, the
                Guards of the March spend much of their time outside
                the city patrolling the farming areas to the west.

                to the city's finest artists and artisans, and is the place to
                go if you're looking for jewelers or sculptors. Low Mountain
                is home to most of Sayre's dwarves, and hidden
                weaponsmiths and armorers are available to anyone
                who can gain a prior recommendation from a dwarf.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Sayre is built in a small, defensible valley. Steep hills
                to the north provide protection from overland armies
                and make excellent spots for small defensive guard
                posts. The Lake of Songs sits uphill to the northwest of
                the city. Dammed at its outflow to help control floods,
                this lake is used year-round for fishing and recreation;
                it is extraordinarily beautiful and the subject of many
                paintings and tapestries by local artists. The Singing
                River descends from the lake and splits briefly into
                three branches as it flows through Sayre. A tall cliff
                guards Sayre's eastern flank, dropping 200 feet to the
                valley below. The only direction an invading army
                could easily approach Sayre from is the west, across
                the farms and fields, and guard towers alert the town
                to any threat approaching from that direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before Sayre was built, the city of Auger stood on this
                site, built over 400 years ago as a refuge for exiled diviners.
                A diviner named Auglos and his apprentices were
                driven from the island of Nefelus after he prophesized
                a local noble's death and was blamed by the man's relatives.
                After fleeing the family's wrath, Auglos settled
                in this particularly beautiful and defensible valley to
                continue his research into divination and communication.
                More academics and sages slowly joined him, and a
                small city - Auger - grew up around his tower.
            </p>
            <!--
            <p>
                Auglos's skill as a craftsman began to bring him
                fame. At first he specialized in divinatory devices
                such as crystal balls. His masterpiece was a huge glass
                globe the color of the evening sky, a device that could
                transmit messages thousands of miles and even across
                planes if individually crafted receiving mirrors were
                first attuned to it. Auglos sold the communication
                mirrors for extremely high prices, typically to merchant
                consortiums or the rulers of more prosperous
                city states. His customers never knew that if he chose,
                he could hear and see everything that passed through
                one of his glass devices, and that he also sold much of
                the information he obtained through his eavesdropping,
                resulting in an even more profitable secondary
                business in the espionage trade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Auglos knew that his glass globe created psychic
                ripples in the Astral Sea when it was used, but he
                didn't consider it a problem; how likely was it that
                anyone would be bothered? He should have done
                more research. His master glass, the device attuned to
                all the others that allowed him to listen in on so many
                fascinating conversations, created ripples near the
                githyanki city of Tu'narath, and psychic debris from
                the glass's communication soon caught the githyanki's
                attention. The githyanki quickly determined that
                someone on the mortal realm was using the energy of
                the plane to fuel a communication device. Paranoid
                in the extreme, within three months, the Lich Queen
                Vlaakith herself named this device the Bitter Glass
                and decreed that the psychic pollution must be eliminated.
                Her knights quickly carried out her orders.
            </p>
            <p>
                The raid on Auger was terrible to behold. Githyanki
                dragonriders shattered the town's dam, flooding the
                streets with water and mud, then proceeded to pick
                off fleeing citizens one by one. By the end of the night,
                Auglos and his assistants were dead, and the Bitter
                Glass was shattered and buried under the broken
                tower that housed it. Auger's remains were looted and
                abandoned, and survivors from the raid left the area,
                never aware of the reason behind the attack.

            <h3>Rebuilding</h3>
            <p>
                Shepherds moved back onto the site within sixty years,
                but without a dam on the Singing River, the site of
                the former city had become a flood plain whenever it
                rained. Finally, dwarven engineers rebuilt the dam on
                the Lake of Songs, and Sayre was built where Auger
                once stood. The level of the land had risen after so
                many years of floods, and none of the old buildings
                were still visible above ground. All residents of the
                modern city know that there is an old city beneath the
                streets, and some families dug down to take advantage
                of a pre-made cellar by digging through the roofs of
                old buildings, but enough people caused cave-ins or
                unleashed monsters that it's now illegal to dig into the
                undercity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sayre is ruled by a wily half-elven politician
                named Lord Divian Torrance, and under his direction
                the city goes out of its way to attract the finest artists
                and craftsmen in the land. As a result, many wealthy
                families call Sayre home, and all of these have their
                own mercenary security forces to protect their
                houses and workshops. Not much of a public militia
                is needed, although a small force controlled by Torrance's
                good friend General Taramin remains active.
                The public militia is subsidized by a public ordinance
                crafted by the wily Lord Torrance. Each family above
                a certain income level must commit a number of
                troops from their own personal guard units to the
                city's defense. This makes the city's safety the concern
                of all the wealthiest families, although it requires a
                charismatic and skillful general to keep all the different
                house troops in line. Sayre boasts a small theater
                and a large university that attracts scholars from cities
                across this corner of the mortal realm. For such a
                small city, Sayre is a shining beacon of light. Lord Torrance
                fully intends to keep it that way.

            <h3>Sayre Districts</h3>
            <section id="Fisher District">
                <h4>The Fisher District</h4>
                <p>
                    Located at the northern tip of the city, this low-lying
                    area is prone to floods during the spring rains. Fishermen
                    and fishmongers who live here ply the lake for
                    their trade and live in raised huts. It's possible to buy
                    fish in the market district, but the freshest fish can
                    be bought by those brave enough to come north up
                    muddy streets and buy the catch coming off the boats.
                    There isn't much crime in the Fisher District; most
                    fishermen have large families, and they police their
                    own neighborhood with stout clubs and many friends.
                    Interestingly, this is the one neighborhood that isn't
                    defined by the breaks of the river. Fishermen live on
                    both outer shores and both inner ones, crossing the
                    rivers in small boats or over swaying rope bridges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ketch's Catch:</strong> This small fish stand has a reputation
                    for bringing in some of the largest, tastiest
                    fish in the lake. More importantly, the stall is run by
                    Gloriana Ketch. She makes a business of tracking city
                    gossip while her husband is off fishing, and she's a
                    good source for anyone who wants to know the latest
                    city rumors about the nobles or anyone of importance.

                <h4>Prospect Hill</h4>
                <p>
                    This residential neighborhood holds the majority of
                    the city's grand estates and mansions. Flanked by
                    rivers on either side, the low hill rises gradually over
                    the rest of Sayre. This neighborhood was the heart
                    of the ancient City of Seers. All the richest citizens
                    of Sayre live here. There is virtually no crime here,
                    and private mercenary units ensure that the neighborhood
                    stays safe. Unsavory types moving through
                    Prospect Hill should expect to be challenged several
                    times, especially after dark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Pillar of Hope Reborn:</strong>
                    This ostentatious
                    memorial is a 60-foot-tall pillar with an eternal, magical
                    flame atop it. According to the plaque this marks
                    the spot of "Auglos the Wise's tower in Auger, first
                    founder of the city that became Sayre." It's not particularly
                    accurate, being located almost 200 feet from
                    Telicanthus's mansion and the actual site of the tower,
                    but it's a good meeting spot for young couples on
                    Prospect Hill who wish to go courting after dark. The
                    beggars of Sayre have a yearly competition, awarding
                    50 gp to anyone of their ilk who can surreptitiously
                    climb the pillar and extinguish the flame. Guardsmen
                    usually find crippled and dead beggars under
                    the pillar for weeks afterward.

                <p>
                    <strong>Telicanthus's Mansion:</strong>
                    Marked by gate pillars
                    boasting lanterns made from exquisitely blown glass,
                    this mansion was bought by Telicanthus and renovated
                    after the former owner moved south. It's one of
                    the social epicenters of Prospect Hill, and servants
                    and guests enter and exit it during most daylight
                    hours (or later, if Telicanthus is hosting a party.) A
                    competent and wily butler (Telicanthus's <span class="hidden">sociopathic</span>
                    servant Pennel) monitors all guests and stops anyone
                    who doesn't belong. Telicanthus's guards are notably
                    polite as they escort interlopers off the property. <span class="hidden">
                    Unlike other parts of the city, none
                    of General Taramin's city militia come within three

                    This neighborhood on the eastern edge of Prospect
                    Hill is home to the city's artists. Sayre attracts many
                    of the finest craftsmen to this area. The wide roads
                    are lined with shops and stores, and are roughly
                    grouped by type of business. Businesses selling expensive
                    goods, such as goldmakers and jewelers, typically
                    have their own security. There's an atmosphere of

                    cost 15 gp a night, an outrageous amount compared
                    to other inns in the city, but rooms seldom go empty.

                    <strong>The Rose Window:</strong>
                    This shop carries only the
                    finest stained glass and sculpted crystal. Bando Hammerglass
                    is as knowledgeable a dwarven craftsman
                    as you can find, and can usually identify a stained
                    glass window's craftsman if the individual is famous
                    enough. He charges high prices for high quality art, but
                    is happy to talk to visitors.

                    <strong>The University of Sayre:</strong>
                    Founded by a priestess of Ioun who was appalled with
                    the lack of learning among most people she met, the
                    university is a bustling school of higher learning that
                    teaches everything from agriculture to esoteric magical
                    theory. Students tend to be young and from out of
                    town, as the university recruits the best and brightest
                    from many different areas. The university is often
                    viewed as an excellent finishing school for noble sons
                    and daughters, and it isn't uncommon for loyal servants
                    to be seen dragging their drunken masters back
                    home after a rowdy night in the Dregs.

                    <strong>The Tankard of Ink:</strong>
                    This is a popular tavern
                    for students who want to be in stumbling distance of
                    their rooms after drinking, and for those who don't
                    care for the Dregs. Many professors from the university
                    have adopted the tankard as their own, as well.
                    This is the place to come if you want a philosophical
                    debate instead of a fistfight.

                <h4>Low Mountain</h4>
                <p>
                    While most races have integrated nicely in Sayre,
                    the dwarven inhabitants tend to keep to themselves.
                    Low Mountain is a neighborhood of high stone walls
                    and twisting streets. Non-dwarves have trouble finding
                    places in Low Mountain, as none of the streets
                    are labeled, and none of the buildings are numbered
                    or named. As they say, "If you need to know where
                    you are in Low Mountain, you probably shouldn't be
                    there."
                    The area is safe, with squads formed exclusively
                    of dwarven guards patrolling the streets after
                    nightfall, but it's not particularly exciting to nondwarves.
                    That changes if you're a dwarf, or have the
                    trust of one. Wonderful restaurants, clever sages,
                    and master craftsmen hide within the featureless
                    buildings. Some dwarves will accept a bribe to guide
                    outsiders to the right place and introduce them to the
                    right contact.

                    <strong>Deep Cartography:</strong>
                    This small shop contains
                    two dwarven brothers, Andor and Toris Scrollstone,
                    sages who specialize in maps and locations. Commonly
                    consulted by explorers into the Underdark and
                    merchants who have long journeys ahead of them,
                    the Scrollstone brothers are the people to consult if
                    one wishes to learn more about Sayre's undercity.
                    They have old maps showing what
                    buildings used to be where.

                <h4>The Market</h4>
                <p>
                    This is the heart of the city for everyone but the
                    wealthiest citizens. The streets are full of people
                    from all walks of life, and any non-exotic object (as
                    well as many exotic and rare ones) can be purchased
                    here. Whether you're looking for ink from a giant
                    octopus or the feather from an angel, you're likely to
                    be able to buy it - or something that the seller swears
                    is authentic - somewhere in the market. This area is
                    characterized by narrow streets, tiny shop stalls, yelling
                    shopkeeps, and a multitude of different bazaars.
                    Due to the university, the market contains a great
                    number of booksellers and scrollmakers. Debt-ridden
                    sages who have been forced to sell their library
                    crouch side by side with itinerant thieves peddling
                    stolen spellbooks.

                    This elderly beggar holds court
                    at the edge of the market. She is taken care of by
                    regulars in the market who consider it good luck to
                    throw her a few coins when they pass by. In return,
                    she is unfailingly friendly to anyone who doesn't treat
                    her with contempt. Agnes is always happy to pass a
                    few minutes chatting with strangers, and she's the
                    best resource for finding something quickly, as she
                    has a good memory for what merchant has what sort
                    of item.

                    The name for the farmer and tannery district is usually
                    correct, with the stink of the livestock blowing
                    away to the southwest. This district is characterized
                    by wide pens, warehouses and slaughterhouses,
                    and stockyards where herd animals are sold. On
                    the rare occasions when exotic animals or monsters
                    are brought into the city, they're kept in Downwind
                    until sold.

                <h4>The March</h4>
                <p>
                    The March looks almost like a military parade ground.
                    This area was once the preferred spot for Lord Limbic
                    the Scholar, a former ruler who had an obsession with
                    statuary and monuments. As a result, he spent a great
                    deal of the city's coffers on self-aggrandizing monuments.
                    More than two dozen great statues, triumphal
                    arches to non-existent battles, and other spectacular
                    monuments stand in this area. They're starting to
                    decay somewhat due to a lack of interest in keeping
                    them pristine, but they define this section of the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Dangle:</strong>
                    This was originally named "The
                    Triumphal Arch of Limbic the Gracious" until it was
                    turned into the city's location for public execution and
                    punishment. Murderers are hanged from the 30-foot-tall
                    arch and left to dangle for a few days. Public
                    stocks are also located here, for punishments of a less
                    severe nature. Public executions are rare in Sayre,
                    and the city hasn't seen one in months.

                <p>
                    <strong>The Guard Barracks:</strong>
                    Sayre doesn't require a
                    large standing army thanks to the proliferation of
                    private guards, but the one hundred full-time city
                    militia the city employs are stationed in this gray, austere
                    building that is also known for its statue of Lord
                    Limbic standing on the roof.

                <p>
                    Most of the city's entertainment is located in this
                    rundown, old section of the city. Dancehalls, seedy
                    taverns, pawn shops, breweries, and comfort houses
                    all crowd its narrow alleys. The area isn't immediately
                    dangerous to visitors, as thugs paid by local businesses
                    roam the streets with the intent of keeping people
                    safe in the theory that "a live customer is a paying
                    customer." They've been known to look the other way
                    after dark, though, especially for a sizeable bribe.

                    <strong>Inn of the Ugly Dog:</strong>
                    This tiny inn sits above
                    a loud and raucous tavern. The namesake dog has
                    been stuffed by a taxidermist and magically animated;
                    it staggers around the tavern to greet visitors.
                    The Inn of the Ugly Dog has cheap ale, mostly clean
                    rooms, good prices, and an ever-changing array of
                    owners as the property is a common stake in the
                    inn's games of chance.

                    These are the slums of Sayre, and the area where the
                    city's undesirables live. Beggars and unsavory visitors
                    gather here, along with anyone too poor to pay for
                    lodging elsewhere. Abandoned and crumbling warehouses
                    hold rotting goods or illegal and smuggled
                    property. The streets are narrow and twisting, made
                    slick by constant mist that rises from the waterfalls.
                    Dark and smoke-stained buildings house beggars
                    with wet coughs from the constant moisture. Rats
                    scuttling through glassless windows provide one of
                    the few free food sources for the locals. It isn't an
                    attractive place to live, and visitors who show weakness
                    are likely to be preyed upon by the locals.

                    This abandoned plaza is surrounded
                    by vacant buildings. The githzerai living in
                    Sayre have taken over one of them, reinforcing it and
                    using it as a temporary headquarters.

                    The local temple to Tiamat, worshipped
                    in her role as Goddess of Greed and Envy, is located in
                    an abandoned warehouse across the street from the last
                    bridge in Sayre. Beggars congregate in this area each
                    morning before heading out across the city. The beggars,
                    strangely, won't speak to anyone while near Lowbridge.
                    They won't ask for money until they've gone to other parts
                    of town, as they're careful not to draw attention to the
                    activities of the Filth King (leader of the city's beggars).
