            adventuring party the Dawn Wardens encountered the army early by happenstance and stymied its advance by collapsing the ancient 
            dwarven bridge at Skull Gorge. In the interim they rallied the people of the vale to defend against the Red Hand and ultimately

            tribes that live in the wild reaches to the north and
            west of Elsir Vale. All told, she spoke for a group of
            twenty-five tribes.
            Fierce, wild, and haughty, she was stubborn and
            opinionated, and wasn't afraid to engage in a protracted

            someone else's idea out of hand, only to bring it back
            up minutes later as a concept all her own.

            Fangren was a demonic gnoll and chief of the Wicked Fang tribe who plagued the lands around 
            the Giantshield Mountains. Receiving aid (in the form of weapons and advisors) from Sarshan, 
            Fangren took up residence in the abandoned monastery, Fortress Graystone.
            He attempted to use the planar energies of the Elemental Chaos woven into the place by its 
            githzerai creators to perform a ritual that would turn him into an exarc of the demon lord 
            Yeenoghu. Our heroes killed Fangren's followers and shadar-kai allies before halting the 
            Fangren's ritual sacrifice of Bin and instead channeled the ritual's energies into a ritual 
            of their own that released Amyria from her sword. Melvin mysteriously disappeared while exploring 
            Fortress Graystone, only to reappear months later fighting the githyanki. Among Sarshan's gifts 
            to Fangren was the magical blade called Wicked Fang in honor of his tribe.

            Fariex the Scalehammer was a tall, richly dressed man with a burnished dark complexion.
            He was a powerful merchant with interests
            in various cities. Fariex did not represent a city
            or other political body, but was invited to the Gatekeepers because of his
            connections to many far-reaching settlements, townships,
            and ports, and the wealth and military might
            they represent. 
            He was light-hearted by nature, and knew more jokes
            than most jesters. Far from a buffoon, however,
            he expected respect. 
            He was slow to weigh the facts of a problem instead of quickly
            making up his mind.
            Generally quiet, Fariex would occasionally interject a pointed question,
            especially if the topic of conversation touched on his
            area of expertise (namely, money and its movement
            through business affairs). He openly tried to 
            catch others in duplicity or engage in some word play
            over a statement he perceived as absurd.

            worn down by these encounters and his own traps before attacking, pretending to help them 
            against other enemies if it looked like someone else might successfully collect the bounty.

            Inogo Dravitch was a dragonborn priest of Erathis. Inogo hailed
            from the distant city of Sherrbyr (Festivus' home). This city lies far
            to the northeast, beyond Elsir Vale by at least three
            weeks' travel. Inogo was the current leader of this city of
            temples. A theocratic city state, Sherrbyr also boasted
            a massive college of divinity, where worshipers of
            nearly any deity could openly practice their faith.
            As a result of its varied populace, the city's leadership
            was formed of a council of priests of the most
            worshiped deities in the city. The council changed as
            the population changed. Some deities fell out of favor
            while others rose. But Erathis's worshipers had been
            a power in the city for years, and Inogo was the most
            recent in a long series of Erathis-worshiping council
            leaders known as Deacons.
            Sherrbyr was a city accustomed to nearly endless
            debate, thanks to efforts to accommodate every faith
            represented on the ruling council. As someone long
            schooled in this approach to government, Deacon
            Dravitch was well out of his league in a group that needs
            to make decisions quickly and decisively. He represented
            a powerful city, however, in terms of both its
            military and divine might. Sherrbyr could field a veritable
            army of healers, as well as a mounted corps of
            paladins. Inogo was mostly quiet in the meetings,
            speaking up only when a plan of action is proposed.

        <span class="description">
            Sinruth was a hobgoblin with greater aspirations than
            a life spent preying on the fringes of civilization. He
            listened closely at the campfires when his fathers
            and uncles told tales of the Red Hand of Doom, a
            mighty army that ran across the land like a scythe.
            And when he became an adult and a leader of his
            own band of hobgoblins, he found a cache of tunics
            and weapons left behind by that army. Sinruth felt
            his destiny calling. He declared himself the new
            Warlord of Sinruth's Hand (as he named the group),
            emblazoned every possible surface with a crudely
            painted, downward thrusting red hand insignia, and
            set about recruiting the massive army that he felt was
            his birthright.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But starting an army wasn't as easy as those campfire
            tales led Sinruth to believe. Years passed with
            Sinruth's band eking out a meager existence in the
            wilderness. But slowly, he started to gain allies. A
            temporary bargain with some sinister, mischievous
            gnomes blossomed into a lasting friendship. The Red
            Hand's exploration of the mountains unearthed some
            undisturbed catacombs beneath the long-ruined
            Castle Rivenroar. Sinruth struck another bargain,
            and the undead guardians let the Red Hand move
            in, in exchange for periodic payment of kidnapped
            prisoners.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sinruth and the reconstituted Red Hand had a
            base and a growing reputation, but they were far from
            a mighty army. An "Emissary" from another remnant of
            the Red Hand offered to join forces under Sinruth's
            banner and more than double Sinruth's fifty soldiers
            under arms. All Sinruth had to do was attack Brindol,
            steal some relics from the original Red Hand invasion,
            and take enough prisoners to keep the undead
            guardians of Rivenroar satisfied.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sinruth personally led the assault on Brindol, sacking 
            Brindol's Hall of Great Valor, stealing back

        <span class="description">
            Tusk was an orc leader is an overlarge warrior and chieftain. Not a true orc, he has the blood of
            ogres in his veins, which made him larger, tougher,
            and eminently more dangerous. Having slaughtered
            half a dozen orc chieftains, he drew together the
            unruly tribes to mount an offensive against Bordrin's
            Watch to lay claim to the soft lands beyond its walls.
            Tusk knew the history of the Stonehome Mountains
            well, knowing that unless he could find some way to
            bypass the fortress in the mountains, it wouldn't matter
            how many warriors he commanded since he would fail.
            What Tusk needed was a way around the fortress.
            Ever resourceful and with numerous contacts and
            allies, Tusk turned to his occasional lover and advisor,
            a shadar-kai witch named Myrissa. He sent her back
            to the Shadowfell to recruit allies to help his cause,
            and a short time later she returned with a small army
            of dark ones, led by a mysterious and sinister dark
            creeper, known as the Emissary (Modra). This leader offered
            to assist Tusk in exchange for an exclusive arrangement
            in which they would supply Tusk's armies with
            weaponry for whatever price Modra asked, and in exchange, the dark creepers
            would find a way through the mountains. Tusk readily
            agreed and paid the exorbitant price, gaining a
            fine arsenal, and also, he hoped, the key to victory.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Not long after, the dark creepers returned and
            revealed a number of tunnels burrowed beneath the
            mountain. They showed the chieftain the locations of
            each, explaining how the passages connected one side
            of the mountains to the other. No tunnel was large
            enough to accommodate his entire army, so, Tusk
            gave his horde their marching orders, sending them
            to climb the mountain slopes, while his scouts moved
            ahead to secure the tunnels and prepare the way for
            Tusk and his elite warriors to strike the fortress from
            below.

            <p>
                Once, he reigned supreme.
            </p>
            <p>
                General Zithiruun was a great hero - one of the
                most respected military leaders of a militant race.
                From the great city of Tu'narath, he led armies of the
                githyanki on raids across the Astral Sea, and into a
                dozen different regions and kingdoms of the mortal
                realm. From the deck of the astral galleon Siun'kara
                or the back of Rathoraiax, his great red dragon steed,
                Zithiruun proved an unstoppable force - a champion
                among a race of champions. Even Vlaakith, the
                fearsome githyanki lich queen, acknowledged his
                greatness, heaped great praise upon him.
                And then the great General Zithiruun took on a
                foe beyond even his own prowess.
            </p>
            <p>
                That it was a dragon, a dragon far greater than
                Rathoraiax, everyone knows, but tales of the confrontation
                differ as to whether it was a black wyrm,
                one of the fearsome scourge dragons, or something
                else entirely. But while not everyone knows precisely
                what it was Zithiruun faced, everyone knows what
                happened as a result.
            </p>
            <p>
                A hideous burst of something - acid, perhaps, or
                pure necrotic energy - ripped the life from the red
                dragon Rathoraiax, shredding flesh and obliterating
                entire portions of the beast. And it was this attack
                that felled Zithiruun as well. It stripped the strength
                from his limbs, rotted bits of flesh and even weakened
                bone. Any lesser warrior would have died in that hideous
                moment, but the general clung to life through
                sheer force of stubborn, malignant will.
            </p>
            <p>
                It took years for Zithiruun to retrain and reinvigorate
                his broken body. Even by the time he encountered our heroes, he was a shadow of
                what he once was - weaker in body, far less sound in
                mind. His own people had all but turned their backs
                on him; though his great achievements prevented them
                from executing or exiling him utterly, they scorn his
                weakness and hold him in contempt for allowing himself
                and his mount to be so soundly defeated. By the siege of Overlook,
                Zithiruun served as a lowly operative of Tu'narath's
                forces and he led only lesser warriors into battle
                while answering to and obeying githyanki who would
                once have feared even to speak in his presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zithiruun's native powers had mutated through
                his years of effort as he attempted to reinvigorate
                his body at the expense of his mental prowess. The
                ambition all githyanki share had been subsumed by
                a burning need to prove himself and to regain the
                position and the respect that were once his by right - 
                even as he nursed a resentful hatred of the very people
                whose adulation he so desperately craved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zithiruun had been large for a githyanki, but since the
                destruction and atrophy of much of his musculature,
                he appeared almost impossibly tall and gaunt.
                Mixed with and attached to the traditional leathers of
                his people, he wore a contraption of braces and harnesses,
                constructed of leather straps and iron joints.
            </p>
            <p>
                These braces, supported at his shoulders and by a strap
                across his chest, ran the length of his left arm and left
                leg, as well as a portion of his right leg. It is the straps
                that gave those limbs rigidity; without them, they could
                scarcely move, and not support his weight. This harness
                also granted him full mobility; charged with both
                magic and psychic energy, it permited him motion and
                granted him strength he would otherwise lack.
            </p>
            <p>
                His flesh clung tightly to his skeleton and puckered
                away from old wounds, exposing muscle and even
                charred bone. His left cheek gaped open, revealing
                a bit of metal plate that replaced a fragment of skull.
                A leather strap held the left side of his jaw in place,
                replacing obliterated muscle.
            </p>
            <p>
                He appeared weak indeed, and in some ways he
                truly was. Yet Zithiruun wielded his great silver saber
                with an astonishing, impossible precision, and his
                eyes burned with loathing and ambition to shame even
                the other githyanki.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite his drive, General Zithiruun met his end at the 
                hands of our heroes when he laid siege to Overlook with 
                his mercenary army.
