	<h2>Current adventure</h2>
	<p>
        Back in Overlook, our heroes had several weeks to relax and aid in 
        the reconstruction of Overlook. One day after this respite our heroes 
        were interrupted by an exhausted, panting soldier from Overlook's city 
        militia. The soldier, a human named Coggin, had been sprinting through 
        the city along with nearly twenty other Overlook soldiers trying to find 
        them. Between gasps for breath, the overwhelmed (and slightly star-struck) 
        guard told them why he has been sent:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "My name's Coggin, sirs. I was sent to find you. The guard
        captain asked that you report immediately to the West
        Gate. One of our scouts to the south reported that there's
        some sort of a flying warship headed for the city. It's armed,
        and it isn't built by any race they recognized. After how
        you've helped the city so much, the captain would like you
        on hand in case there's trouble. Sirs."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Our heroes rushed through the streets to the West Gate, lead by Coggin and 
        joined by a growing escort of soldiers as they ran. They were waved quickly 
        through several checkpoints before reaching the walls. Before they gained a
        vantage point beyond the city they heard a loud scraping and creaking noise, 
        like the sound of heavy wooden timbers being dragged roughly across the ground. 
	</p>

	<p>
        When our heroes reached a point that overlooked the west
        and southwest of the city, they saw that a flying galleon
        <span class="future">named the Conqueror and belonging to the githyanki</span> had ignominiously crashed
        into the war-torn turf beyond the city. The mast had
        an improvised white flag hanging limply from it. The
        galleon had skidded to a halt on the ground, and the
        ship looked to have already been in a war. Patches of the
        vessel had been charred by intense <span class="future">red dragon</span> fire, with other
        sections badly damaged as if struck by large weapons.
	</p>
	<p>
        Two lone humanoid figures were visible on board, waiting
        by the rail. Citizens outside the city were fleeing from
        the wreck as quickly as possible, and our heroes
        could hear their screams easily from the wall. Every guard
        nearby had a crossbow trained on the passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The (clearly rattled) local guard captain - a
        female human named Captain Jerra Dauralis - asked
        our heroes to accompany her down to speak with the ship.
        It took only a few minutes to descend the steps and
        exit the city's gate.
    </p>
    <p>
        The warship leaned to one side, and it had clearly been in a
        fight. Its sails were ragged, and the stern of the ship was charred
        from intense fire. A humanoid with greenish skin and gray
        robes stood by the rail <span class="future">Tokk'it</span>, hands held open, 
        waiting for our heroes to approach. 
        Closer to the ship, the other passenger is visibly exhausted and anxious, 
        but just as clearly recognizable as Melvin. Breaking into a broad grin he saluted 
        his old companions:
    </p>
    <img src="pcs/Melvin.png" class="right" />
    <img src="npcs/Tokk'it.png" class="left" />
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "Greetings friends! I'm glad to see you. It's been a while since we've talked so I 
            though I would drop in and say hello. This githzerai is my friend and traveling companion Tokk'it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In all seriousness though, I've come to beg your help. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I know I disappeared on you back in 
            Fortress Graystone, and for that I appologize. I was summoned to the aid of my missing master Marduk Goldbludgeon
            via the psychic network linked to that ancient githzerai stronghold. He attempted to use it 
            to pull me through the Elemental Chaos to him at a similar githzerai fortress called Akma'ad where he and 
            other members of our monastic order were under attack by their mortal enemy: the githyanki. However, a 
            covert attack by the githyanki during my transit severed my connection to my master and left me stranded 
            in the Elemental Chaos. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There I met Tokk'it and after a long journey to together we returned to what passes for civilization on that 
            plane. We alerted the other githzerai in their city of Zerthadlun to the attacks and the damage to their 
            psychic network. With their help we managed to repair it long enough to send some reinforcements to Akma'ad, 
            including the two of us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our reinforcements were insufficient however, as during our long travels githyanki reinforcements arrived to 
            swell the ranks of the sieging army. I gather you've seen them here as well. The tide was quickly turning against 
            my brethren so in a desperate gambit a squad of us snuck through the siege lines, slew this ship's captain and commandeered the 
            vessel from the enemy to escape and seek aid from you here. We managed to disable another ship before we got away. 
            We were chased and attacked by githyanki lancers riding red dragons but we were able to outpace them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Akma'ad is some 140 miles southwest of here, about a day's journey in this tub if we can fly her properly. 
            I don't know the exact numbers of the enemy, but I saw three war galleons like this one here and at least three 
            lancers, so I'd guess two or three hundred. There were nearly 100 trained monks at Akma'ad and several dozen non-combatants.
            We need to return with help before the githyanki breach our fortress and exterminate my brethren. 
            Please, time is short and we must hurry." 
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Captain Dauralis, silent up to this point, suggested that the Council would not approve depleting the troops from 
        Overlook in the wake of General Zithiruun's invasion. Instead our heroes used their contacts to recruit a small force 
        of mercenaries to aid them while the city made the ship flight worthy again. In less than an hour our heroes were aboard 
        with small rescue force as the newly christened "Holy Cow" took to the air.
	</p>
    <img src="tactical/The Conqueror.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        Tokk'it led our heroes to the bridge - a relatively bare room, boasting a runic
        circle on the floor and a ship's wheel standing before
        it. Windows around the room allowed the captain to
        see forward and arrowslits allowed spellcasters to target
        attackers to port or starboard outside the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dead githyanki captain's body lay in a heap on
        the side of the room. The rear of the bridge featured a
        heavy tapestry giving glory to a tall githyanki knight
        standing triumphantly before a throne.        
    </p>
    <p>
        Tokk'it stood in the ritual circle, taking the wheel and concentrating. As he did so disembodied moans 
        and screams started to echo about the ship as the psychic echoes of possessed githyanki sailors manifested as translucent shimmers 
        to man the rigging. Tokk'it explained that this was normal - if a typically despicable piece of githyanki magic. When some of our 
        heroes began to confuse githyanki with githzerai Tokk'it was quick to elucidate them on the distinctions - at length.    
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "The githzerai and the githyanki were once one people in the ancient past, enslaved by the mind flayers. After countless 
            generations of brutal oppression, our people developed some of the psionic powers of their masters until one day the hero Gith 
            arose to lead us to freedom and break the illithid empire.
        </p>
        <p> 
            However, once her people were free she went too far. She launched a crusade to exterminate every last one of the 
            mind flayers, turning the former slaves into a conquering army rather than a free people. Thus the githyanki - 'the children of Gith' 
            were born.
        </p>
        <p> 
            A great mind, Zerthimon, spoke out against Gith replacing one tyranny with another, demanding she step down. She refused and a civil war 
            followed that nearly destroyed us all. Ultimately Zerthimon defeated Gith in single combat, and in his wisdom showed her the way of peace 
            and spared her life. He exiled her and her followers to the Astral Sea where they became little better than bloodthirsty pirates. 
            Zerthimon claimed the Elemental Chaos for his people - my people - the githzerai: 'those who spurn Gith.' 
        </p>
        <p> 
            To confuse githzerai with githyanki is an insult. Do not make the mistake again." 
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Tokk'it went on to admit that he doesn't fit in well with other githzerai. He had been rebuked by his elders for a lack of emotional control 
        and disordered thinking. He found some acceptance with the female Gallia while they were romantically involved, but she broke up with him 
        several months ago, and he hoped that proving himself a hero with this rescue mission might lead to a reconciliation.     
    </p>
    <p>
        Elsewhere onboard, Melvin explained how important this mission was:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "This githyanki attack could not have come at a worse time.
            Most of the githzerai at Akma'ad right now are visitors. The
            abbot is hosting a meeting of extremely important religious
            and political leaders. Kath'ik from the Monastery of Nine
            Stones, Most Exalted Odos from the House of Reprisal,
            Wellik the Elder from the Tower of Dancing Flame ... all
            leaders that the githzerai look up to. I think they are deciding
            who will lead them in the upcoming war, and how involved they
            will be in aiding our world."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Kitara headed belowdecks to search the ship. Picking the lock to the captain's cabin, she found documents identifying the vessel as the 
        Conqueror and the deceased captain as one Captain Dav'ot. The ship's manifest listed a full contingent of 140 troops, one dragon and one 
        lancer, and a gish assassin named Brann'ot. There were orders signed by a Captain Iquel ordering the Conqueror to accompany the Sacrifice 
        and the Tyranny from Tu'narath to attack the githzerai stronghold of Akma'ad:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Dav'ot,
        <p>
            We expect the attack to go smoothly and quickly.
            Our informer is inside Akma'ad already, and has
            agreed to assist Brann'ot in the assassination of the
            foul githzerai leaders. Once you receive the signal
            from my flagship that the defenses are neutralized,
            land the Conqueror at a safe distance from the
            fortress and disembark all of your troops along with
            the Tyranny.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the grace of High Emperor Zetch'r'r, Lord of the
            Astral Sea,
        </p>
        <p>
            Captain Iquel</br>
            The Sacrifice"
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In the first officer's cabin Kitara found three small, hand-drawn portaits of githzerai 
        <span class="future">Odos, Kath'ik, and Wellik - the githzerai leaders then meeting in Akma'ad</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Less than an hour after our heroes departed Overlook
        on the damaged galleon, it sailed through wispy clouds. 
        Suddenly, Lechonero spotted movement ahead from his perch in 
        the crow's nest. Two red shapes flew out of a
        cloud, changing direction and speeding up as they moved in
        our heroes' direction. Lechonero saw two red dragons, each with a rider
        strapped on its back, and called the crew to arms, manning the ballistae 
        on deck.
    </p>
    <img src="places/The Conqueror.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        The highly maneuverable dragons strafed the Holy Cow with their firey breath, allowing the lancers 
        to make charging swipes at the defenders on deck and be away before they could fight back, but 
        Lechonero's keen aim whittled the dragons down and kept them from lining up ideal strikes against 
        the ship. Combined with an assault by the mercenaries manning the ballistae and coordinated by Barases, 
        the dragons were slain, forcing the lancers to glide unnaturally through the air to land on the deck 
        and engage our heroes in melee.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as our heroes dispatched the githyanki Lechonero called out from the crow's nest again. 
        The red dragon closing on the ship was larger than the two
        they just fought. There was one scarred githyanki riding it. This veteran dragonknight proved more 
        strategic then his compatriots - attacking Lechonero directly to disable our heroes' best ranged 
        attacks and staying out of the firing arcs of the ballistae. Still, Lechonero proved the more resilient, 
        forcing the dragonknight to the deck where the rest of our heroes dealt with him handily.
    </p>
    <img src="places/Akma'ad.png" class="right" />
    <img src="tactical/Akma'ad.png" class="left" /
    <p>
        Our heroes passed over fields and woods that gradually
        give way to a reddish rocky waste as they approached
        the githzerai fortress. They saw signs of the battle before
        they saw Akma'ad itself; fire and smoke rose from the site
        in a dark pillar. The Holy Cow crested a final mountain range and saw Akma'ad below.
        The fortress was utilitarian and stark, with
        red walls rising up over a dusty valley. An overhanging
        mountain cave amde it extremely defensible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Akma'ad was surrounded by githyanki troops and a vessel 
        identical to their own approaching them, troops moving on its deck. From the lettering on the gunwale, Lechonero 
        identified it as the Sacrifice. Melvin rushed to the pilot's cabin and took the helm from Tokk'it. The two ships 
        jockeyed for position, the ballista shots from each going wide. Barases organized a boarding party among the 
        mercenaries - readying grappling hooks to bind the ships on their next pass. Once again they failed to ram 
        one another upon their bow spikes, but Barases' grappling team caught the gunwales of the Sacrifice from a higher 
        angle. The mercenaries brought the ships side by side, the Holy Cow hull resting on the edge of the Sacrifice's deck 
        and Barases, Kallista, Kitara, and Karrion jumped dow to board the enemy ship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Helpless against the grapples and as the boarding party cut through her troops, Captain Iquel made good on her ship's 
        namesake and steered her into the Holy Cow's hull, scraping it's keel across her own deck, destroying her sails and 
        scattering the melee to deadly effect. Bereft of it's rigging, the Sacrifice lost its flight magic and hung as a dead 
        weight from the grapple lines - causing the tied ships to begin a death spiral toward Akma'ad below. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Lechonero attempted to join the melee by leaping from the Holy Cow's crow nest to the rigging, only to have it 
        collapse under him and tumble gracelessly 40 feet to the deck of the Sacrifice below.
        When Captain Iquel emerged from the helm and laid about her with magic Kitara answered in kind - the two wizard swordswomen 
        swashbuckling across the heavily listing deck as bits of rigging from both ships fell about them. In the end Kitara brought 
        Iquel to her knees and battered her across the deck and with a final magically-enhanced kick booted her off the gunwale to plummet 
        to the ground far below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unable to prevent their eventual crash, Barases evacuated everyone back to the Holy Cow and strategically cut the grapple lines 
        to drop the Sacrifice onto a force of githyanki on the ground. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On the way down, it was clear that two squat guard towers perched
        on top of the steep cliff containing Akma'ad. Chains were stretched between them,
        holding back what must have been hundreds of tons of rock and
        rubble. Several githyanki were guarding the towers.
        Melvin managed to steer the Holy Cow into a rough landing against the 
        towers. Quickly disembarking our heroes overwhelmed the githyanki squad guarding the clifftop and released 
        Akma'ad's landslide defense on the army below.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a tremendous, deafening roar, a cascade of rock - from
        pebbles the size of a pea to boulders the size of a mule -
        tumbled down onto the githyanki army massed outside the
        walls of Akma'ad. At first, all our heroes saw was a blinding cloud of
        dust, but as the wind cleared it from the field, they saw that
        hundreds of githyanki troops had been pulverized by the
        rock, and the rest were scattered or fleeing outright.
    </p>
    <p>
        Karrion teleported the party into the midst of the remaining githyanki hugging the walls 
        of the fortress while Lechonero sniped dangling from the chains that formerly restrained the landslide. 
        Taken by surprise, our heroes wiped out the stragglers and were taken into Akma'ad by its defenders who 
        had been holding a breach in the wall. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The githzerai had suffered serious loses since Melvin's last count. Only about 50 fighting githzerai 
        still survived, including Tokkit's Gallia.  
    </p>
    <img src="npcs/Odos.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        The surviving githzerai, many of them wounded, gathered
        around an old blind githzerai who seemed as aware of his
        surroundings as if he could still see. The monk spoke in a
        rough tone. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "We're alive. I don't know how they knew we
        were here, but the cost was high. Too high. Both Kath'ik
        and Wellik are dead, along with dozens of our brothers and
        sisters. We lost the abbot and most of the monastery. Our
        conference is finished. Now I must decide our path." 
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        With an almost undetectable grimace, the stoic
        githzerai turned his empty eye sockets toward the lines
        of dead and wounded. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Gather your belongings. In the
        morning we travel to Sayre. There is a conference there
        I am obligated to attend before we depart for home." 
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        He paused and turned his sightless gaze in our heroes' direction. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "You aren't githzerai, but you fought for us. Who are you?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Tokk'it introduced our heroes and explained their
        role in the battle. Most of the githzerai hailed them as heroes,
        and Odos (the blind githerzai) grudgingly thanked them,
        but he was exhausted and grieving for his slain friends and 
        came across as dour, pessimistic, and suspicious. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In speaking with Odos, our heroes discover 
        that he was concerned greatly about
        his people and their future. He worried that Sayre was only a
        temporary solution, and doesn't know if there's anyone he
        or the githzerai can trust other than themselves. Odos was a
        good and just leader, and his taciturn nature was a reflection
        of the hardships his race has endured, exacerbated by the
        recent attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        He reveals that the githyanki attacked without
        warning, and they sent strike teams to the personal
        chambers of all the githzerai leaders, as if they knew exactly
        who to attack and where they were staying. He was convinced
        someone fed them information on the layout of Akma'ad,
        as well as the names of the leaders present. Odos himself was spared
        only because he stepped outside for a walk and heard the
        team of assassins in his room on his way back. He surprised
        the squad of three and defeated them single-handedly.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the githyanki assassins
        in his room had a small device that could be held in her
        hand. She was speaking into this object when he surprised
        the assassins in his room. It was green and looked reflective.
        Festivus inspected the shard of green glass, identifying it as 
        some type of magically one-way communication device, allowing the 
        carrier to transmit a message through some unknown ritual.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apparently attacks of this sort had been
        happening to githzerai enclaves and monasteries all over
        the mortal realm. Most had fled to a refuge in Sayre, a
        nearby city. Odos wanted to take his people there after the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Odos and the other githzerai had planned this
        meeting at Akma'ad to discuss whether or not to accept an
        invitation in Sayre to meet with a newly formed coalition
        of leaders from other regions of the world concerned with
        the extent of the githyanki invasion. Each comes from a
        homeland ravaged by the githyanki, and they're all looking
        for aid and support from their regions. Odos was bitter that
        the "humans" (he has a tendency to call all non-githzerai
        and non-githyanki "humans") sound divided over political
        issues when there's so much at stake. He was against going
        to the meeting, but after the battle felt that going to Sayre was the only
        choice for his people.    
    </p>
    <p>
        Tokk'it sought out Gallia to introduce her to our heroes. In the process of
        seeking her out, Tokk'it spoke with other githzerai,
        many of whom remark how they believed she was
        dead because she was trapped on the upper roof and surrounded.
        When Tokk'it found her, he is overjoyed she is alive, but she 
        acted coldly toward him and shrugged off
        any questions about the battle.
    </p>

        When Tokk'it introduced Gallia to Karrion, she was polite but formal and quickly 
        excused herself. Tokk'it was upset and Karrion attempted to console him with 
        platitudes before awkwardly excusing herself as well.

        Sayre was over twenty miles away across rough terrain,
        and the githzerai had wounded who had to be
        pulled along in small carts. Due to the slow pace, it
        took two days for the githzerai to reach Sayre with
        their patients. Under the ministrations of Festivus and Barases and
        any githzerai healers, the injured troops began to heal.
    </p>
    <p>
        One the first night of the journey, the githzerai camp was quiet. 
        Even the wounded seemed to have found some peace in the wilderness. 
        Suddenly the peace was shattered as a commotion at the edge of the camp turned into an a series of 
        hit-and-run attacks. Kitara and Barases chased the assailants into the woods.
        Once they were out of sight a githyanki emerged straight out of the
        ground at Lechonero and Festivus' feet, a silvery longsword poised to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a lengthy pursuit Barases and Kitara abandoned the chase and turned to 
        return to camp only to be ambushed by their prey - aided by a masked female 
        githzerai. They defeated the ambush, but the masked githzerai disappeared into 
        the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lechonero and Festivus were pinned down by the gish assassin Brann'ot - a vicious melee 
        fighter who put the two ranged combatants at a severe disadvantage. Ultimately they 
        managed to spread out and encircle him, between their arrows and spells limiting his 
        movement until they could whittle him down.

        Licking their wounds the band continued on to the city of Sayre. After several days travel 
        they descended from the mountains and found themselves on the fertile floodplain surrounding the city.
    </p>
    <p>
        They made a leisurely journey around the Lake of Songs - dammed at its outflow and used year-round for
        fishing and recreation; its beauty a work of art. They followed the Singing River as it descended from 
        the lake past bucolic farmlands and for the first time in weeks began to feel themselves relax. 
    </p>

    <p>
        During the journey Festivus regailed her companions with tales of her years studying
        the Arts at the famed University of Sayre. She had run away from her home in Sherrbyr, 
        fleeing the repressive society of her youth. Seeking a more accepting culture 
        she came to this flamboyant metropolis which valued beauty and knowledge over religion.

        They heard the distant sound of church bells long before they
        actually saw Sayre. It lay in the valley below them, nestled
        between three rivers. Sunlight reflected from the city's canals.
        Although it had roughly the same number of inhabitants as
        Overlook, Sayre was a very different city. It was said to be a city
        of artists, artisans, and scholars, and one can see why. The
        sunlight filtering through the hills gave a golden glow to the
        entire valley. From where they stood, they could see mansions and
        palaces rising up from islands between the rivers, university
        halls jutting upward, numerous monuments and large statues,
        and the smoke from smithies rising into the air. Mist from a
        huge waterfall swirled along the southern edge of the city.
    </p>

    <p>
        A guardhouse stood in front of the great bridge that
        lead over the river into the city. A throng of people bustled
        about - buskers, salesfolk, travelers, beggars, and guards.
        Even a few rich nobles could be seen, riding in open-top
        carriages in their finery.
    </p>
    <img src="npcs/Pennel.jpg" class="right" />
    <p>
        A servant approached our heroes, haltingly. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Excuse me, but by any chance are you the Heroes of Elsir Vale?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        When they confirmed their not-so-humble identities the man continued:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "My master will be so pleased! You're quite famous; he was
        just talking about you today at tea. Would you do me the
        honor of allowing me to introduce you?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Given permission, he looked even
        happier and lead them through the throng to a darkdoored
        wooden carriage with remarkable stained
        glass windows. The carriage was pulled by two horses.
        The servant knocked once and opened the door.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "My Lord Telicanthus, may I please introduce the famous Heroes of Elsir Vale."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        A tall, spindly man stepped out into the sunlight. Lord
        Telicanthus was a githyanki.
    </p>
    <img src="npcs/Telicanthus.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        Fresh from their near-deadly encounter with Brann'ot, Lechonero had a near-violent
        reaction to the newcomer, warning "Githyanki!"
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Of course I am! I'm not associated at all with those
        murderous fellows in the Astral Sea, though. No, I left
        that life years ago and I've never regretted it once. I'm a
        glassmaker now, and a loyal citizen of this fine city. We
        can't help how we're born, but we can choose how we live
        our lives. Something that everyone really ought to learn."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        He was quite unlike any githyanki that our heroes had
        seen before, however. Lord Telicanthus had a warm,
        quick smile and eyes that make it clear he was very
        interested in whomever was speaking. He wore very
        fashionable, expensive clothing and had no githyanki
        jewelry or weaponry whatsoever. His handshake was
        firm, his voice clear, and he had only the faintest
        trace of an accent when he addresses the group:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "It's such a pleasure to meet you. We've received some news
        of our friends to the north, but I never expected to meet the
        heroes in person! Some travelers have brought word of your
        many battles. It's very rare to meet living heroes, so this is
        quite a moment for me. Are you just arriving here in Sayre?"
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        "Well, allow me to provide you with some most humble
        shelter! The finest inn in the city is the River Jewel, right by
        the bridge in our Glassworks District. Pennel?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        he turned to his secretary, just exiting the carriage.    
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Run ahead to the Jewel and book... [counting the group] Rooms for
        each of them. Put it on my account there, meals included.
        Let them know that their guests are people of honor, and
        are to be treated as such. It's so rare to get people of the world here, artists aside...
        Would you do me the honor of coming to tea
        tomorrow? All the elite in the city, from the mayor on down,
        would doubtlessly be honored to meet you. You'll be the toast
        of the town. Tomorrow, at my estate - I'll have Pennel leave
        details for you in the morning, and I'll send a carriage."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        After Telicanthus' carriage departed, our heroes found that the guards 
        had refused to let their Githzerai companions
        cross the bridge into the city.
