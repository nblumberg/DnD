    <h2>The Shadow Rift of Umbraforge</h2>
    <p>
        Previously our heroes discovered that
        dark creepers had sold arms and tactical intelligence
        to the orc war chief Tusk, aiding him in his attack
        against the folk of the Stonehome Mountains.

        Sarshan is an opportunistic shadar-kai arms
        dealer. For years, he has built an invisible mercantile
        empire around the sale and brokering of weapons,
        armor, mercenaries, and intelligence from his domain
        in the Shadowfell.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Modra.png" title="Modra" class="right"/>
    <p>
        In the past Modra (a lieutenant of the blackmarket arms dealer Sarshan) was approached by Tusk's advisor Myrissa, a shadar-kai
        witch who knew of Sarshan's operations. However,
        the success of Sarshan's arms running and mercenary
        services turned on his ability to maintain a low profile
        in his dealings with clients in the world. Sometimes
        this meant turning down jobs that run too much risk of
        exposure. Tusk's massive raid, aimed at the heart of the
        civilized frontier and a stone's throw from Sarshan's
        operations in the city of Overlook, was one of these.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Sarshan rebuffed Myrissa's request, Modra
        approached the witch in secret. He struck a deal to
        supply Tusk with weapons and intelligence, sending
        in a group of his followers (the dark creepers in the Vents, including Iranda) to do the job.
        In going behind Sarshan's back, Modra expected that
        an overwhelming orc victory (won with the help of
        dark one subterfuge) would win his master's respect.
        However, with Tusk's forces routed and Modra's servants
        scattered or killed, the dark creeper had to
        go to ground to escape Sarshan's wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trapped in the natural world, Modra needed to reclaim Iranda's brass key - a key to a secret portal back to the Shadowfell.
        As our heroes began investigating the purpose of the key back in Overlook, Modra heard word of their efforts and
        hired the "Lost Ones" assassins to eliminate our heroes and retrieve the key.
        Underestimating the party, they not only survive the assassins' attack but manage wrest Modra's name from the survivor.
        Asking around about "Modra", our heroes learned the following:
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "The threat of the orcs might be ended after the
                    siege of Bordrin's Watch, but word from the frontier
                    is there's more trouble on the march. Just like
                    Tusk's clan, the rabble of the mountains are getting
                    their hands on good-grade weapons and armor, and
                    they're looking to use it."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "You get all races in Overlook, but the dark ones that
                    pass through the city keep to themselves. More often
                    than not, those you do see are in the company of
                    Lost Ones bodyguards and enforcers."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Someone by the name 'Modra' was said to be
                    buying information a few months back, looking for
                    those with experience mining the old caverns of the
                    Stonehome."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Modra is a dark creeper, and well known in the
                    city's criminal underworld."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "It's said that the dark creeper Modra brokers weapons
                    and armor through the Overlook black markets."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Modra met up with a shadar-kai witch a month ago.
                    Some said she was doing a deal for weapons, but she
                    didn't look much like a warrior."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The far traders coming into Overlook talk of more
                    and more trouble on the roads. They say the Red
                    Hand of Doom was behind what happened in Brindol
                    a few months past, but there's more cults than
                    that on the rise across the frontier."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The dark creeper is just the front man for arms
                    dealing in the city. No one knows who's behind the
                    operation, but rumor says it's bigger than anyone in
                    Overlook will ever know."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Modra was in the city three weeks past, but he was
                    keeping a low profile. He had a squad of dark creepers
                    with him, must have figured they'd stand out."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Last time anyone saw Modra was just before the
                    raid on Bordrin's Watch. I heard he's been on the run
                    since then. Some job that went bad."
                </li>
            </ul>

        Ensorcelled by a magical tankard she discovered in the
        Monastery of the Sundered Chain Kallista disappears during the investigation.
        But losing one member the party finds
        another character making similar lines of inquiry
        regarding the dark creeper Modra. The woman wore brown leather
        beneath a green cloak, and a longbow is slung across her
        chest. Quietly, she said
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "I've heard word that there's a group
        in the city looking for someone named Modra. I'm doing the
        same, though I doubt it's for the same reasons. Perhaps we
        should compare notes."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        This was Reniss,
        sister of the half-elf warlock Jen of the Farstriders. When Jen was
        slain in the Vents, she used a sending
        stone to whisper her last words to her sister, a name
        the Farstriders tripped across before they were cut
        down - "Modra...."
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "I met a dark creeper close to death in the Clean Sheets,
        looking like he'd been in the fight to end them all. He said
        he'd been working for this Modra when it happened. For
        a quart of bad beer, he told me that if I was looking for
        Modra, I'd better be fast. Someone else is hunting him -
        someone looking to kill him. The creeper didn't know where
        Modra was, but he'd heard him talk about some Tradetown
        almshouse called the Happy Beggar."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Our heroes follow Reniss' clues to Tradetown, and the Happy Beggar,
        a single-story almshouse sandwiched between a warehouse
        block and a section of rundown tenements. What
        no one outside of a small number of dark one and
        shadar-kai operatives knew at the time is that the almshouse
        is owned by Sarshan, and it conceals the heart of his
        arms-running enterprise within the city.
    </p>
    <img src="../tactical/The Happy Beggar.png" class="right"/>
    <p>
        Prashant and his wife Ausma ran the Happy Beggar
        on the proceeds of their former life as adventurers,
        unaware of the real purpose of the building.
        The atmosphere inside the Beggar was as dingy as the
        whitewash on the outside walls. A plain common room
        sits two dozen miserable-looking patrons, most asleep in
        their chairs or sipping at cracked mugs. A few
        double as volunteer staff, carrying steaming teapots from
        table to table. Behind what would be a bar in any other
        establishment, a dour-looking human woman in white
        robes boils water at a wood stove. A similarly attired male
        greets you as he limps up a flight of stairs across the room.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Sarshan (in disguise).png" title="Sarshan (in disguise)" class="left"/>
    <blockquote>
        "Greetings and welcome. You are just in time for tea and
        songs of devotion. Please, join us!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Among the sorry lot taking refuge at the Beggar our heroes discover Kallista,
        rescued by Prashant and Ausma from the gutter at the end of a near-terminal bender.
        While investigating, our heroes talked to an old man alone in a rickety chair,
        a hunched form in a tattered cloak. The old man appeared human or half-elf,
        but his face was deeply scarred by the ravages of disease. He coughs wetly
        into a grimy handkerchief and introduces himself as Brenat:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "I know the one you mean. A dark creeper, and none
        as dark as him, or so I've heard. Time was, he used
        the Happy Beggar as a meeting place, but I'd reckon
        he hasn't been seen here in two years or more. I ran
        him off one time myself. I might not look it, but I
        fought dark creepers in the mountains as a younger
        man, sellsword to a dozen lords. Much as yourselves,
        I'd wager. Adventurers all have a price, eh?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        This man was actually Sarshan in disguise, in Overlook on business and hunting Modra.
        When he deduced our heroes' intent, he figured he could have them take care of Modra
        for him:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Wherever you find this Modra, heed me. He's a black-hearted
        one - make no mistake and strike no bargains with him. Kill
        him quickly before he gets the chance to return the favor."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Sarshan was not aware that our heroes possessed Iranda's key, and to his surprise they
        infiltrated his smuggling route in the basement of the Happy Beggar.
        Desperate to escape Sarshan, Modra did the same a step ahead of the party and stole another key from
        one of Sarshan's underlings to pass through the portal into the Shadowfell.
        Hot on Modra's heels, the party used Iranda's key to
        open the portal to Umbraforge, Sarshan's base of operations in the Shadowfell.
    </p>
    <img src="../places/Umbraforge.png" title="Umbraforge" class="right"/>
    <p>
        Modra left a trap on the portal that delayed the party's pursuit,
        and they arrive alone on the outskirts of Umbraforge, Sarshan's
        domain in the Shadowfell.
    </p>
    <img src="../maps/Umbraforge.png" title="Umbraforge" class="left"/>
    <p>
        The land before our heroes was like nothing they'd ever seen before.
        A wide plain of gray-green grass and stunted black trees
        spread beneath a sky scoured by fast-moving clouds. The
        sun was bright above but somehow didn't cut the darkness
        that drapes every rock and every blade of grass in gray
        gloom. It was the Shadowfell.
        From the mouth of the cavern, a wide and well-traveled
        road runs in a curving line to the north. There, perhaps a
        quarter-mile away, a military camp spread. Buildings were
        scattered here and there, with tents and pavilions spreading
        between them. Torches and fires burned brightly against the
        ever-present shadow, and lone trees and tall stands of graygreen
        grass were whipped by a hissing wind.
        Looming above it all, a rise of black rock to the west was
        rent by a seething volcanic rift. Black-streaked lava coursed
        from it to descend into a narrow channel, and a permanent
        pall of glowing red-black smoke rose above it. Over this
        molten flow, a great stone bridge arched. This wide eastwest
        road met the road north from the cavern. North of
        the bridge, a tall tower stood and a lower building spread
        in its shadow.
    </p>
    <img src="../places/Umbraforge markets.png" title="Umbraforge" class="right"/>
    <p>
        The party approached the frontier of the mercenary camps
        unchallenged, and a virtual city spread out before them.
        Beneath patched canvas tents stood open-air taverns,
        market stalls, apothecaries and herbalists, weaponsmiths
        and armorers, butchers and greengrocers - all doing
        roaring trade.
        Training grounds opened up between the various camps,
        and soldiers of different races clashed against each other with
        sword and shield. In the quieter corners, they saw combat
        casters training - the flare of arcane fire dancing between
        them. But as they approached, they noticed with surprise that
        these were not Shadowfell mercenaries for the most part.
        Though shadar-kai and dark ones are well represented,
        the fields and camps were packed with orcs and hobgoblins,
        ogres and trolls, lizardfolk and kobolds and a dozen other
        monstrous races of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Searching the camps for Modra, our heroes come across the following information:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "This is Umbraforge, dominion of Sarshan, a
            trader of great reputation and even greater
            wealth. The tower, foundry, and forges are
            his. The camps are those of the mercenaries
            and slaves whose services he sells across the
            Shadowfell and the world."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sarshan is shadar-kai, an outcast who made
            a name for himself as the leader of a legendary
            mercenary band known as the Black Arrow.
            At their height, the Arrow put so much
            fear in generals and kings alike that Sarshan
            would take payment to fight for one group,
            then take a bigger payment from their foe to
            stand down."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Modra is known well in Umbraforge, but for
            all the wrong reasons now. He was one of
            Sarshan's trusted lieutenants before he tried
            to a broker a weapons deal that Sarshan had
            already turned down."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The job that Sarshan refused was some orc
            king's raid on a dwarven citadel. Sarshan
            never makes a sale if it has a chance of coming
            back to him, and for good reason. This
            job went bad, they say, and people know that
            Modra sold the orc his weapons."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Modra is long gone from Umbraforge and
            the Shadowfell, believe me. Sarshan's got a
            long arm and a longer memory. The creeper
            would have to be crazy to come back here."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The foundry is the new jewel of Sarshan's
            operations. Its power comes from the fire and
            shadow driving its furnaces. Sarshan's sages
            create beasts of battle there, born killers with
            magic in their blood."
        </p>
        <p>
            "It used to be that Sarshan brokered mercenaries
            mostly within the Shadowfell, but that's
            changing. Dark ones and shadar-kai are still
            his elite troops, but more and more, he brings
            creatures from the world to Umbraforge for
            training, then marches them off to places
            unknown."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The Shadowfell is only a stopping-off place for
            Sarshan's mercenaries. A force of archons from
            the Elemental Chaos was here not six months
            ago. I saw githzerai from the Astral Sea in Umbraforge
            once. I don't know what job they took
            for Sarshan, but woe be to whoever got in their
            way."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sarshan's slave bazaar is about more than just
            servants and soldiers. His experiments in the
            foundry only begin with dumb beasts. He's
            building new soldier races there, born from the
            slaves he traffics."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sarshan's mercenary operations have tripled
            in size in months past, but it's not the Shadowfell
            they're fighting in. When his forces are
            bought and sent on the march, they're bound
            for portals to the world. Shadar-kai, dark ones,
            undead, giants, ogres, trolls, gnolls, orcs -
            Sarshan has the armies of two planes on the
            march. War is brewing in the world, but the
            forces that will fight it are moving into position
            in the Shadowfell, unseen."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Eventually our heroes were approached by the shadar-kai witch
        Leena, a lieutenant of Sarshan's and a former friend of Modra's.
        She wore a black cloak edged with
        adamantine beads, and she kept her long hair plaited to
        hang down her back. Gold piercings lined her ears and lower
        lip, and a black starburst tattoo enclosed her right eye. She has the
        following to say:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Modra and I worked together for a time, but when he
        elected to go behind Sarshan's back, I told him we were
        done. I heard word of him in the camps even before you
        started asking around. He has a plan to disrupt Sarshan's
        operations by destroying the foundry, then the tower.
        Sarshan has a private tunnel connecting the two, and
        Modra is planning on venting the foundry's destructive
        energy there. A mass of mercenaries is moving out tonight.
        He'll be using that as cover when he goes inside.
        "Modra's made his bargain with fate, and honor decrees
        that he die for his betrayal. He won't get tears from me. But
        if Sarshan captures him, he'll die slowly. If it's you, I'll hope
        you make it quick."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Trailing Modra to the dark foundry, our heroes heard a claxon call of horns
        sound out from the west. A haze of
        red light glimmered against the clouds as the cascade of the
        magma shadow rift flared. As Leena predicted, a huge force
        of mercenaries was on the move, heading out along the east
        road. The area around the foundry was deserted; the guards
        at the tower and the bridge had turned eastward to watch
        as Sarshan's forces moved out.
    </p>
    <img src="../maps/Umbraforge foundry.png" title="Umbraforge foundry" class="left"/>
    <p>
        Inside the foundry the red glow of the lava trench was shrouded by shifting
        clouds of shadow and steam. Huge stone vats with steel
        doors lined both sides of this massive chamber, where
        great arrangements of pipes and vents connected them.
        Half the creatures inside the vats are humanoids mutated into horrible
        warlike forms, their skin growing spiky armor plates,
        their hands turned to razor-sharp claws, and so on.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/Umbraforge foundry.png" title="Umbraforge foundry" class="right"/>
    <p>
        Two squads of what looked like hobgoblins, their bodies
        seemingly cloaked in shadow, worked there, supervised
        by another cloaked figure. They worked busily at two
        sections of pipe that diverted and channeled the lava flow.
        Closer to the door, two other shadowgoblins stood guard.
        Disguised as one of his minions, Modra spotted our heroes,
        snarled as he sprinted for the closest vat,
        pulling down on a great lever next to the door. He dodged
        out of the way of a blast of steam. As the door opened, it
        spilled a huge mass to the ground in a fountain of viscous
        green fluid. Out of it rose an enormous two-headed boar,
        bellowing as it clawed the ground.

        His followers defeated and backed into a corner, Modra attempted to slip
        into a secret passage but Lechonero shot him down before he could escape.
        Driven to discover Sarshan's plans for the massive troop movements, our
        heroes follow the secret passage into the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our heroes exited the secret passage into an apparently library within the tower.
        Dim light filled the area from globes of gray glass set around
        the room. Shelves of books and scrolls line the walls there,
        and a large table covered with scrolls and bound volumes
        dominated an adjoining chamber. A female shadar-kai
        stood there, looking up in astonishment. Two shadar-kai
        warriors, katars at their belts, scrambled away from the door
        in surprise. A third warrior is digging through books on a
        nearby shelf, his greatsword leaning against the wall a few
        feet away.
    </p>
    <p>
        After dispatching Sarshan's guards, the party explored deeper into the tower
        and heard growling voices punctuated by yipping snarls beyond a door.
        Inside were a pair of adjoining rooms that appeared to be well-appointed
        guest chambers. Unfortunately, the occupants seemed
        ill-suited to their comforts. Four gnolls <span class="future">emissaries from the Wicked Fang tribe</span>
        were there, and a reek of dog filled the air and the blankets on the beds had been pulled off
        and piled in the corners.
        The closest two snarled as they lunged at the party with spear and
        claw, and the others fired their longbows as they took
        cover behind a couch.
    </p>
    <img src="../pcs/Barases.png" title="Barases" class="right"/>
    <p>
        After slaying the gnolls and further exploring the tower, the party discovered two captives held prisoner in cells not much
        less comfortably furnished than the guest rooms for the gnolls:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A young human who identified himself as Barases and claimed to be a traveler
            in search of his lost brother Petraynus who wandered into Umbraforge as part of his investigation and was imprisoned by Sarshan for trespassing.
            <span class="future">While some of his claims were true, Barases eventually revealed himself to be a Satyr in disguise, and
            while Sarshan did imprison him during his search for Petraynus, he was actually kidnapped from the Feydark when he stumbled across
            some of Sarshan's mercenaries.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            A hulking Goliath by the name of Camulos.
            Camulos' story was somewhat more direct: a mercenary who took work with Sarshan's armies, he
            took objection to some of Sarshan's more amoral practices and was imprisoned for his interference. Freed from their
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Freed from their cells the prisoners joined our heroes. While continuing their search of the tower, the party started to notice
        tremors occasionally shaking the tower. While attempting to get high on the visage of the strange trees in the 2nd floor tower garden
        Karrion discovered the psychic levitation lift passing up through the center of the tower. As the party floated upstairs,
        dim light from globes of gray glass casts faint shadows
        throughout the dark garden. Though the trees and other
        foliage there appeared healthy and luxurious, the leaves,
        stems, and flowers of the plants were sickly shades of dark
        blue, gray, and black. Along the south wall of the chamber
        stood a stone arch identical to the teleportation portals
        the party used to reach Umbraforge. As Festivus attempted
        to inspect the portal - finding it locked - a hissing sound
        preceded a cloud of insects suddenly boiling
        up from the shadows, swarming to attack. At the same
        time, what appeared to be a mass of mottled leaves rose
        up to reveal itself as an enormous beetle with viscous
        black fluid dripping from its joints as it lurches toward them.
    </p>
    <img src="../pcs/Ringo.png" title="Ringo" class="left"/>
    <p>
        The party dispatched the swarm of insects and Lechonero, Barases, and Karrion put their animal handling skills to the test and tamed the
        Shadow Beetle. Lechonero kept the beetle as a pet and named him Ringo.
    </p>
    <p>
        Taking the lift to the top of the tower, our heroes surprised a squad of Sarshan's personal guard at practice which raised a general alarm.
        Waves of shadar-kai guards streamed in from the main hall below and our heroes, nearly overwhelmed, were forced to retreat to a dead end at the top of the tower -
        Sarshan's personal quarters. Festivus bought the party some time by dismissing her floating disc - covered in hundreds of pounds of looted, sharp weapons - at the
        top of the tower shaft, burying a group of guard ascending the lift. In their few spare moments the group frantically searchesd the room for escape or ideas.
        Escape was not fortcoming, but they did discover some of Sarshan's notes among his possessions. <span class="future">Chief among these notes were obscure references to a
        place of lost riches - obscure references to the Karak Mines that ultimately help Bram Ironfell determine the location of the lost mines.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually the shadar-kai were too numerous to resist, led by their grizzled captain Thannu, who had ritual scars standing out on his cheeks.
        Two umbral panthers moved at his side with teeth bared as they hissed. Despite the overwhelming numbers, our heroes were dug in hard at the top of the tower,
        leading Thannu to yell:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Stand down! Or your lives are forfeit!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Suddenly, the garden was illuminated by a pulse of white
        light. The archway to the south flared as it revealed the black
        shrine under the Happy Beggar, and a familiar figure stepped from that chamber to
        this. It was the veteran our heroes spoke to in the Happy Beggar, but
        he was no longer stooped with the appearance of age and his
        scarred skin turned gray before their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The guards around the party saluted the shadar-kai, who
        didn't hide his surprise at seeing them. He took in the
        scene before him with a cold eye.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Sarshan.png" title="Sarshan" class="right"/>
    <blockquote>
        "I am Sarshan. I assume
        someone has an explanation for this?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Thannu delivered a quick, military-style report to Sarshan concerning the party's incursion into the tower, along with the number of dead and wounded.
        Even as the captain finished, a warrior entered at a run,
        calling to his master. As he approached to whisper in
        Sarshan's ear, the shadar-kai turned to the party with a look of
        wonder.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "You are, quite literally, the last people I ever expected to
        see here. The charges leveled by my captain warrant torture
        and death. However, I am told that an episode of sabotage
        in my foundry appears to have been thwarted, and that the
        traitorous Modra has been executed by persons unknown.
        What might you know of this?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        After taking credit for dispatching Modra, Sarshan nodded thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "As far as you've managed to infiltrate my operations, I can
            only assume you know a little of who I am. My wealth and
            reputation turn largely on honor, obligation, and secrecy.
            When I spoke to you of Modra, I hoped you would kill him
            and save me the risk of more exposure than he had already
            caused. The fact that you journeyed here to do the job is
            a surprise, but for your part in ending his threat to me
            and whatever he meant to do in the foundry, I am in your
            debt. However, for your role in the death of my personal
            guards, you are more greatly in mine. Here is a bargain that
            balances the obligation for all of us. Join me...
        </p>
        <p>
            We are mercenaries, all
            of us, but only a precious
            few have honesty enough
            to admit it. Whether we
            sell ourselves for coin,
            for honor, or ideals, we
            all have a price whose
            continued payment
            leads us inevitably to our
            end. But when that end
            comes, will you admit
            to your balance sheet?
            Or will you lie when you
            claim that the blood on
            your hands was spilled
            for just cause, not simply
            your hunger for glory?
        </p>
        <p>
            Your skill at arms is clearly first rate. I offer you a place
            to use and advance that skill. Moreover, I offer you a place
            where you might live long enough to enjoy the fruits of your
            bravery. In a month, or six, or a year, your world will be a
            place you will not want to live. Join me here instead...
        </p>
        <p>
            Though I am nicely positioned to take advantage of these
            things, I know relatively little yet. What I do know, I cannot
            share for professional reasons, but trust me when I say that
            you do not want to know. Name your choice, friends."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        With few options, our heroes reluctantly accepted Sarshan's offer.
        At that moment they felt a familiar shaking beneath their feet as another
        tremor rose and fell quickly.
        Then suddenly, an ear-splitting explosion shook
        the tower. Near the eastern side of the chamber, one of
        Sarshan's guards shouted out:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "My lord! The foundry is in flames!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The guards sprang into motion, Sarshan all but
        ignoring our heroes as he barked orders. One group was sent to the
        foundry, and another received orders to keep the mercenary
        camps under control. Sarshan took a last squad of
        chainfighters with him as he moved for the lift. Thannu and
        his panthers were the only ones left with the party.
        Bitterness at the men under his command dead at our heroes hands
        he confronted them before attacking:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "If I was as cruel as my reputation implies, I would
        send you back to watch your world die. Be
        thankful that I am merciful."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Drained by their earlier battles, our heroes barely survived the encounter with Thannu.
        From the south windows, Camulos describes the chaos in the
        camps as mercenary bands try to pull back from the
        destruction. The pens of the slave bazaar were
        broken open, and the slaves had overthrown their
        masters and started fleeing to the north.
        Peering out the eastern windows Lechonero warned that
        the foundry was being consumed by ongoing explosions
        of shadow and flame. Thanks to Modra's sabotage the foundry's systems have failed, releasing the
        arcane energy that fuels Sarshan's dark experiments and threatening to destroy the tower.
        Unable to escape through the heavily guarded front doors, Festivus frantically raced against
        time to unlock Sarshan's private portal in the tower gardens. Just before the foundry explosions
        consumed the tower and collapsed the portal, she managed to open the way and our heroes tumbled through back to the world and Overlook.
    </p>
    <p>
        The noise of the explosion was heard in the Happy
        Beggar, with Prashant and Ausma discovering the
        secret cellar and the route the party took into the caverns
        below. They arrived just as the our heroes are cleaning
        up and were astounded to discover what lies beneath
        their establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The paladins took care of contacting the Overlook
        authorities. While they waited for the city guard to
        arrive, our heroes confirmed that the Shadowfell gate
        has been permanently destroyed. Sarshan's route
        into Overlook had been shut down for good.
        With their religious background, Ausma and
        Prashant recognized the area as a place
        of ancient demon worship. They concluded that the
        dark power that created the specters had festered
        within both sides of the Shadowfell archway all this
        time - a potentially grave danger to Overlook that our
        heroes had eliminated. The teleportation portal was still
        operational, but it could be shut down by representatives
        of the Council.
    </p>
    <p>
        The discovery and destruction of the Shadowfell
        gate makes the party heroes in Overlook, especially
        when Sarshan's connection to the recent orc raid
        was revealed. The shadar-kai's warehouses were
        raided, but in the aftermath of Modra's treachery,
        Sarshan had been careful to clean up any evidence
        of his recent activities. Though his operations are
        shut down for good, no further information on the
        shadar-kai's presence in Overlook could be found.
