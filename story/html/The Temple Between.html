	<h2>The Temple Between</h2>
	<p>
		The towering walls of Overlook rose slowly but steadily over
		the horizon as our heroes drew ever nearer their destination. From
		a distance, the city looked as secure and serene as ever, but
		as they moved closer, they could see that all was not as they left it.
		A great mass of activity bustled around the gates, people
		lugging stone and timber this way and that, all beneath the
		watchful eyes of sentinels who stood dutifully atop the wall.
		One particular blond-bearded dwarf in plate armor - <span class="future">Captain Aerun</span> - stood atop the gate shouting
		orders to everyone in sight.
	</p>
	<img src="../npcs/Captain Aerun.png" class="left" />
	<p>
		Although the activity didn't appear especially rushed
		or frantic - indeed, they saw people pausing to talk or jest
		with one another as they worked (and when Captain Aerun wasn'’'t
		looking) - it appeared as though Overlook were mobilizing
		for war.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our heroes were hailed as they approached, while the sentinels
		atop the walls and by the gates offered friendly
		but careful greetings. Multiple crossbows were trained
		on the party until they identified themselves, but once
		they did, their welcome became far warmer. Several
		workers and soldiers stopped to clap their hands, and
		the sentinels swiftly lowered their weapons and stood
		taller at their posts. Word had spread of their heroics
		on behalf of the city so far, and their return was seen
		as a good omen.
	</p>
	<p>
		Speaking with the blond-beared dwarf officer:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		"Well met, members of the Dusk Wardens, and welcome back to Overlook. I am
		Captain Aerun. Yes, the city is making preparations
		for war, though I don't personally see the need. It's not that we anticipate any specific
		trouble, and indeed, the Council of Elders and the
		various priesthoods hope that, with
		the defeat of the orc invasion and the closing of the
		Shadowfell gate, this city is good and safe for a
		long time to come. Still, recent troubles have stirred
		up a strong <i>better safe than slaughtered</i> mentality
		among the populace and the city leaders, and so
		the Council of Elders have ordered that Overlook's
		defenses be repaired and enhanced. I've been placed in charge of the effort."
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Settling back in at Overlook our heroes took a moment to relax and recuperate after their
		travels and ordeals. Festivus went in search of her ocassional lover Bram Ironfell - only
		to find he was called out of town on business for the Elsir Consortium. Barases scoured
		the city for signs his brother Petraynus had ever passed through. And Kallista once again
		nearly drank herself into the gutter. Ultimately the party collected that evening at the
		Pig and Bucket Tavern, which is were Nerislove Stoneheart found them.
	</p>
	<img src="../npcs/Nerislove Stoneheart.png" class="right" />
	<blockquote>
		"Begging your pardon, m'lords and ladies, but you look
		familiar to me. You are the folks who saved us from the orcs,
		and from those foul creatures of shadow, aren't you?...
		Well, I'm sorry to disturb you and all, but there's someone
		been looking for you. Woman named Lavinya? She's
		a priestess at the temple of Erathis, over in the Divine
		Knot. She's been leaving messages all over town - says she
		desperately needs to speak with you. She begs you to come
		see her at the temple, just as soon as you can get there."
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		The next day our heroes answered Lavinya's call and went to the Divine Knot.
		They cannot help but notice, as they pass, that the old temple
		of Moradin appears to be under as much construction as
		the city ramparts. Great frameworks and ladders stood
		alongside the building, and they could see lumber stacked
		along the inner walls through the open windows.
	</p>
	<p>
		When our heroes inquired about the work going on at the old temple,
		one of the locals reported:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		“Oh, that. High Ancestor Durkik recently assigned most
		of his underpriests to restoring the old temple. Something
		about wanting to expand, I think, so that other races who
		might not be comfortable in the Stonehammer district
		could return to Moradin.”
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		When they finally reached the temple of Erathis it was obvious
		that the priesthood of Erathis had seen better days.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was all but impossible to tell what color the stones of the
		temple might once have been, for then they were a repugnant
		mixture of smoke-stained gray, dirty-handprint brown,
		and bird-dropping white. The stenches of the Nine Bells
		district appeared to congregate there, as though seeking
		admittance and absolution, and our heroes had seen zombies
		that looked (and smelled) healthier than some of the
		unfortunate, impoverished souls shambling along the
		streets with empty eyes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Three wide steps that didn't appear to have been swept
		in days rose toward a heavy wooden door that boasted a
		relatively fresh coat of polish - one that could not begin to
		conceal the rot beneath.
	</p>
	<p>
		When our heroes
		entered they saw a largely empty cathedral, its pews old
		and candles burned down to nubs. At the far end
		stood an altar to Erathis, which was far better maintained
		than anything around it. A dark-haired and
		gold-robed half-elf, grown old before her time, knelt
		before the altar, rising and turning at the sound of the
		door.
	</p>
	<img src="../npcs/Lavinya.png" class="left" />
	<blockquote>
		"Thank you. I knew Erathis would guide you to me."
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		For a few moments she waited on the party, offering
		what comfort she could, pointing them toward the pews
		at the front of the cathedral (the cleanest ones), offering
		a few glasses of cheap wine, and the like. After a
		pause she frowned thoughtfully and began:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			"My name is Lavinya. I'm the last priestess
			here; the others all departed years ago, when the Nine Bells
			went all to seed, and the temples with it. I keep it open and
			functioning as best I can on my own, but...
		</p>
		<p>
			Do you know Haelyn?
			Haelyn is a wonderful old woman. She's the caretaker of
			the shrine to Erathis, over in Tradetown.
			I'm sure you know that most worship of
			Erathis in Overlook takes place there, rather than here. I
			must admit, I haven't always been a friend to Haelyn. I
			was...bitter, very bitter, at what happened to my temple.
			But after a time, we got to know each other, and we've
			become great friends."
		</p>
		<p>
			And that's why I need you! Something is wrong! Something's
			happened to Haelyn, I know it, and maybe not just to her!
		</p>
		<p>
			A few weeks ago, Haelyn just disappeared. I went by the
			shrine to speak with her and she was gone. There's a man
			named Grovald maintaining the shrine now. I don't know
			him; I've never met him before, and nobody I talk to knows
			him, either. He told me that Haelyn left on a spiritual
			retreat and would be back in a few months.
		</p>
		<p>
			But I know better! Haelyn needed no 'spiritual retreat.'
			Her faith was strong, and it was centered on that shrine!
			And even if she had, she wouldn't have up and left - not
			without telling me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I must confess, I went back at night and snooped around a
			bit, not just in the shrine, but peering through the windows
			of the groundskeeper's cottage. I've offered penance to
			Erathis for my trespass, but I had to know what happened!
			I didn't...I found no trace of Haelyn, but I did catch a
			glimpse of a letter through the cracks in the shutters. I
			couldn't read much of it, and I dared not stay long, but
			I'm certain it was addressed to 'G' - that must be Grovald,
			right? - and it began with 'I am commanded to ask if you've
			had any further problems with the worshipers of...' That's
			all I saw, but it sounds sinister enough!
		</p>
		<p>
			And that, is where things got even
			worse. I went to the authorities, but they told me there was
			nothing to look into, that Haelyn - or any citizen - can travel
			as they please. I spoke to some of the other priests - Aelys of
			Bahamut, Durkik of Moradin at the Stone Anvil, Kyrrist of
			Avandra, even Matron Volorvyn of the Raven Queen. Some
			of these have long been my friends, and even those who
			were not have at least been respected colleagues. And all of
			them brushed me off! They were distant, uncaring, even
			cold, as though my worries were of no moment! Volorvyn
			appeared barely to recognize me, and while we've never
			been close, we've known one another on and off for years.
		</p>
		<p>
			And that's when I thought of you, Overlook's new heroes.
			I'm terrified that something has happened to my friend and
			that something is wrong with my fellow priests. I should,
			we all should, be showering you with gifts and thanks, not
			heaping even more cares onto your shoulders - but I've little
			influence left in this city, and I have nobody else to whom I
			can turn."
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		When our heroes agreed to investigate, Lavinya smiled gratefully.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			"You could talk to one of the priests, I suppose. I'm not sure they'd agree to speak
			with you at any length, though. Everyone's so busy with the
			mobilization. And these are important people; you can't
			just, uh, 'hero' your way into the building and confront
			them. Still you might learn something from them.
		</p>
		<p>
			You could examine the shrine of Erathis. You might
			well find something I missed. Or you could search Haelyn's
			home, which is on the same lot as the shrine. I looked for
			her there, but when she didn't answer, it felt wrong for me to
			just barge in. But now..."
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		On the way to the temple of Erathis in Tradetown our heroes stopped in
		at the old temple of Moradin to investigate the construction.
		The amount of work going on there made the place look
		less like a house of worship and more like an anthill on a
		massive scale. Workers of all races scurried through doors
		and windows, clambering up scaffolds of wood and iron.
		The sounds of grunts, curses, shouted orders, and the
		monotonous thump of hammers on nails made it all but
		impossible to hear oneself think.
	</p>
	<p>
		The work continued inside as well as out. Workers with
		boards on their shoulders, wheelbarrows, or heavy
		hammers moved back and forth. The floor was
		covered with dust, both stone and wood, and heaps of rubble
		lay in every corner.
	</p>
	<img src="../npcs/Megan Swiftblade.png" class="right" />
	<p>
		Not everyone there was a simple laborer, however. Leaning
		against the leftmost wall, her eyes narrowing as she
		watched our heroes, was a young, heavily muscled woman clad in
		scale armor. One hand rested on the hilt of a longsword at
		her waist.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		"Well, if it isn't the 'great heroes' of Overlook. Sorry, but
		the construction site is off limits."
	</blockquote>
	<img src="../npcs/Murrik Hammerfist.png" class="left" />
	<p>
		When our heroes attempt to push past, abruptly, one of the dwarf workers turned and stops in front
		of the party, coming within inches of running his wheelbarrow
		over Lechonero’s foot. He hitched his
		thumbs through his belt - a gesture that put one hand
		uncomfortably near the haft of his hammer - and glared
		with beady eyes above a dirty beard.
	</p>
	<img src="../npcs/Ancestor Karros.png" class="right" />
	<p>
		When our heroes attempt to push past, abruptly, one of the dwarf workers turned and stops in front

		over Lechonero’s foot. He hitched his
		thumbs through his belt - a gesture that put one hand
		uncomfortably near the haft of his hammer - and glared
		with beady eyes above a dirty beard.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		"You bastards ain't
		welcome here. You might have the
		rest of the city hoodwinked, but not us. The Hammerfist clan has
		a bone to pick with you over that business in the Thornewaste."
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Murrik Hammerfist continued to antagonize our heroes, several of his
		clansmen begining to form up around him, along with the Freeriders.
		When Lechonero confronted Megan Swiftblade she said
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		"The priests of Moradin hired us to
		make sure the old temple was free of any dangerous
		people or creatures for the renovation. You're starting
		to look dangerous to me."
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Just as things appeared ready to escalate into violence
		a red-bearded dwarf, clad in worker's leathers and a smock
		but with the hammer of Moradin hanging about his neck,
		pushes his way through the crowd.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		"All right, all of you back
		to work! I'm Ancestor Karros of Moradin.
		Why don't I escort you out?"
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		On the way out our heroes softened Ancestor Karros up and got him
		to talk.
		He was concerned that High Ancestor Durkik had assigned almost the entire
		staff of the Stone Anvil to working on the reconstruction
		of the old temple. He had barely kept enough
		priests on hand there to conduct regular services.
		Karros didn't speak ill of High Ancestor Durkik, but he hinted at the
		fact that he didn't approve. The idea of the renovation
		came out of nowhere, and neither Karros nor
		the other priests could figure out why it's being done.
	</p>
	<p>
		High Ancestor Durkik called for investors from Overlook's
		dwarves to aid in the reconstruction. The Hammerfist
		Clan was among those to contribute money and
		workers. Many of the workers had been speaking
		poorly about the party any time their status as
		"heroes" came up in conversation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although he appeared almost unwilling to admit it,
		Karros confessed that Durkik hadn't been himself
		for weeks now. He was worried about the old priest.
	</p>
    <img src="../places/The Stone Anvil.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        Parting ways with Ancestor Karros our heroes proceeded to
        the primary temple of Moradin - the Stone Anvil - in order
        to investigate Ancestor Karros' claims about High Ancestor
        Durkik.
    </p>
    <p>
        As compared to so much of the rest of Overlook, the
        Stonehammer district might almost be a different city.
        Broad, clean streets flow like rivers of rock between
        enormous, sweeping edifices, carved with near magical
        precision. The air is clean there, and the voices heard
        are raised in laughter or negotiation, without the tinge of
        desperation so common in some of the poorer quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
        And then our heroes were there. It rose up before them like a
        fortress, constructed of blocks of stone larger than many of
        Overlook's houses. At its height, looking down upon even its
        tallest neighboring buildings, glint leaded windows in the
        shape of hammers. The doors at the entryway stood open,
        inviting all who would worship, and a good thing it was - for
        these doors are 40 feet high if they're an inch, and the lot of
        our heroes together might have difficulty dragging them open.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was the Stone Anvil, temple of Moradin and the
        spiritual heart of Overlook.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inside the sanctuary - which is no less
        sweeping, magnificent, and ostentatious than the
        building's exterior - our heroes saw about a hundred worshipers
        engaged in prayer,
        heads bowed and chanting in low, sonorous voices.
        The overwhelming majority of the faithful there
        were dwarves. The services were being led by a young
        dwarf female who read from a great, steel-bound
        tome that, when open, was nearly as broad as she was.
        There was no sign here of anything out of the ordinary,
        or of High Ancestor Durkik himself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Things didn't appear so mundane in the halls surrounding the main
        sanctuary, however.
        A great many tasks appeared to have been left undone;
        floors were not swept, candelabras were unpolished,
        torches and braziers had been allowed to burn out.
        Inquiring about this some acolytes explain that most of
        High Ancestor Durkik's underpriests were
        currently hard at work restoring the old temple in the
        Divine Knot.
    </p>
    <p>
        Asking for an audience with High Ancestor Durkik, our heroes were left
        waiting, and when they attempted to explore on their own, going deeper into the
        temple than most worshipers ever travel, they were quickly interrupted. Within mere moments, High
        Ancestor Durkik appeared, accompanied by a contingent
        of the city watch. He demanded, in no uncertain
        terms, that our heroes depart immediately. The guards
        were apologetic, but adamant. High Ancestor Durkik had the legal and religious
        authority to demand that they leave, and the
        guards were there to ensure they did just that.
    </p>
	<p>
		Thrown out of the Stone Anvil our heroes proceeded on
		to Tradetown and the other temple of Erathis.
		As compared to Overlook's other temples, this shrine was poor
		indeed - and yet it offers a sense of intimacy that the greater
		edifices did not. Several wooden poles stuck in the earth
		supported walls and ceiling of heavy fabric, barely enough
		to keep the rain off the altar within it. The altar was littered
		with candle stubs and scraps of parchment, which were the
		remnants of prayers and offerings.
	</p>
	<p>
		Beyond the makeshift sanctuary, a statue of Erathis
		stood in the middle of a pool of stagnant water, staring
		off toward the horizon. Many of the bricks of the pool
		were broken or missing, and a closer glance suggested that
		the "statue" was in fact a fountain at one point, but the
		mechanism had failed - likely many years ago.
	</p>
	<p>
		Several rickety cottages stood on the edge of the
		property, apparently held together by little more than faith
		and an extra coating of paint.
	</p>
	<img src="../npcs/Grovald.png" class="left" />
	<p>
		Several townsfolk moved in and out of the curtain-housed
		shrine, leaving written prayers on the altar and occasionally
		glancing askance at a fellow who paces behind it. He is a tall
		human, bald-headed with features sharp as an eagle's, clad
		all in somber black. He muttered to himself as he paced.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was pretty clear from his body language that the
		man didn't want to be there, though any time one of the
		citizens utters a prayer to Erathis, he replied with a quick
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		"So may it be."
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		When our heroes spoke with him, he introduced himself as
		Grovald. He answered some questions about Haelyn
		with the same "spiritual retreat" story he gave Lavinya.
		He claimed not to know where she went or when she would be back,
		though he was less than convincing.
		After that he dismissed the heroes, claiming to be busy praying
		along with his faithful.
	</p>
    <p>
        When our heroes attempted to search the groundss Grovald threatened
        to call the city watch - forcing them to back off.
    </p>
	<p>
		After the quick exchange with Grovald,
		one of the faithful, an older woman dressed in shabby but
		well-mended shawl and dress, stood up from the altar and
		turned her eyes on our heroes.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		"I know you! Thank you so much for all you've done!
		I couldn't help but overhear, and a lot of
		us have asked him the same questions. We don't trust him,
		and we're worried about Haelyn. Almost nobody comes
		here after dark anymore, so if you want the chance to talk to
		him in private, when he's not so 'busy,' that'd be a good time
		to come back. Maybe you can find out what's going on."
	</blockquote>
	<p>
        Returning at night under the cover of invisibility, Kitara
        searched the temple grounds and Haelyn's cottage. The small cottage
        on the grounds of the shrine looked
        comfortable, but old and rickety. Bricks were missing from
        the chimney, and the paint was peeling from the walls.
	</p>
	<p>
        Picking the lock, Kitara snuck inside; the dust of days, if not weeks,
        lay over a homey little abode.
        An ash-filled fireplace stood in one corner, with an old
        table and two equally old, but comfortable looking, chairs
        beside it. A pantry stood alongside a door that would
        almost have to lead to the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
        A faint stench, foul and out of place with the cottage's
        peaceful appearance, tickled her nostrils. The stench was coming from the pantry, which
        contained several rotting vegetables, fruits, and cuts
        of meat, all swarming with ants and fruit flies. The
        perishable foods in the pantry and a chest of
        clothes almost completely full were not signs of someone
        who was preparing for a long journey.
	</p>
	<p>
        Startled as Grovald entered the cottage, Kitara slipped back out again
        but saw Grovald light a fire in the fireplace and throw some papers into the fire.
        She quickly scaled the rickety chimney and used Mage Hand to draw the burning paper up
        the chimney into her hands. Though partially destroyed, the remains read:
	</p>
    <blockquote>
        "...unreachable for a time, as I must...the priests'
        orders as you would my own, for he...s always, be
        certain you destroy this mis...
        ...eneral Zi..."
    </blockquote>
	<p>
        Their suspicions aroused, Barases spoke to the plants on the temple grounds,
        and discovered that behind the fountain, not far from the nearest tree, a faint
        bulge in the earth marred the contours of the soil. It looked as
        though something was buried there recently.
	</p>
	<p>
        Summoning the city watch, our heroes levelled their accusations against Grovald
        and when the watch dug up the mound behind the fountain discovered Haelyn's
        buried remains and carted Grovald off to prison.
	</p>
	<p>
        Meanwhile, Kallista and Bin went to the authorities about Grovald and were directed to the Ministry of
        War - specifically, the office wherein the officers of the city garrison work. The Ministry of War was
        huge, consisting of six buildings
        arrayed around a central courtyard - all within an imposing
        set of guard walls, of course. As they approached the gate, two
        guards, a dwarf and a dragonborn, stepped forward and crossed
        their spears before them.
	</p>
    <blockquote>
        "State your business within."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Demanded the dwarf. Despite the gruff welcome, the guards were just doing their duty and
        ushered the pair into the office - one of the buildings nearest the main entrance to the compound.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Captain Aerun.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        A dwarf stood up from behind the desk as they entered. His
        blond beard was tightly braided, his armor brightly polished.
        It took them only a moment to recognize him as the officer
        they saw shouting orders from the wall when they first
        arrived in Overlook.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "I'm Captain Aerun. I'm
        honored to have Overlook's heroes in my office. What can I
        help you with?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Aerun listened intently and politely, scowling in
        anger when Kallista mentioned some of the vile things
        she had seen, and shaking his head at the evidence against
        Grovald.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "These are indeed grave matters you bring to me.
        I'll get looking into them at once. And you once again
        have the thanks of a grateful city. Go on and take a load
        off, wherever you're staying. I'll let you know how the
        investigation turns out."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Kallista was suspicious of this apparent brush-off, feeling
        Captain Aerun was more interested in keeping them out of
        the investigation than he was in finding out the truth. In
        response Bin disguised herself as a dwarven clerical worker
        in the offices and began investigating Aerun himself. Though
        she found nothing explicitly incriminating, his plans for bolstering the defense
        of Overlook were wraught with inefficiencies and many apparently
        valid complaints about suspicious activity in the city were going unanswered.
        Additionally, Captain Aerun appeared to be in the habit of leaving the
        Ministry of War on regular "personal" errands unaccounted for in his
        schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kallista took it upon herself to covertly tail Captain Aerun while he
        went on one of his errands. Though he led her on a merry chase, ultimately
        she followed him to the Pig and Bucket tavern. Most of the building's interior consisted of the beer hall.
        Booths lined the walls, while long tables and rear-bruising
        benches filled the middle of the room between. Along the far
        wall ran a wooden bar - she could see the graffiti carved into
        it even from the door - behind which stood stacks of kegs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kallista managed to resist the temptation of the kegs just long enough to summon the
        rest of the Dusk Wardens. Sneaking covertly into shadowy stalls in the tavern they saw
        Captain Aerun in one of the far booths, speaking to a scruffy looking
        individual in a shabby gray cloak. After Captain Aerun left the tavern they once again
        attempted to follow him, when without warning, a number of thugs came charging from
        around corners and out of doorways, and holding their blades high!
    </p>
    <img src="../tactical/Alley Ambush.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        The majority of the party stayed to confront the attackers but Kallista snuck off ahead to
        continue her pursuit of Captain Aerun. When our heroes dispatched their ambushers the bodies
        at their feet warped and shifted - the skin turned pale
        gray and the eyes grew wide and dark. This was no human
        who lay before them! They were dopplegangers, and one had a list of descriptions on it - descriptions
        of our heroes themselves. The list was stained with beer and sausage grease - which Festivus recognized
        as coming from the Pig and Bucket tavern menu they had just left. <span class="future">Captain Aerun had
        set them up!</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile Kallista darted behind pedestrians, into doorways, and through
        shadows, moving street to street without being seen. Using her knowledge
        of the seedier areas of Overlook she guessed that Captain Aerun was headed
        into the Blister. With less crowds to work with, Kallista instead
        darted around corners, climbed walls, tumbled over a gaps
        between rooftops, and leapt between
        roofs and balconies to stays near Captain Aerun at
        angles that made her harder to detect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ultimately she followed him to his destination - a warehouse in the Blister district.
        Nothing in particular made the warehouse stand out. It was
        a large, squat building, with a huge front door that opened
        by sliding up into the ceiling on rails. A rickety wooden
        staircase along one wall lead to a door that
        opened onto an upper level.
    </p>
    <img src="../places/Zithiruun's warehouse.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        When the rest of the party caught up to Kallista, they entered the warehouse by force.
        A vast chamber stretched before them. Rows upon rows of
        crates - some stacked as high as 15 feet - formed aisles and
        corridors. A catwalk ran around the perimeter, as well as
        across the cavernous room at several points, with an array
        of chains and pulleys dangling beneath.
    </p>
    <img src="../tactical/Zithiruun's warehouse.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        Several gruff-looking fellows, the sort you might
        not want to meet in a dark alley but wouldn't be surprised
        to find there, lurked atop the catwalk, atop several crates, and
        around a few corners, crossbows held at the ready.
        Among them was Goodman Kyrrist (a priest of Avondra).
    </p>
    <p>
        A few other foes stood hiding in the shadows, also
        aiming weapons at our heroes. Their gray flesh and huge dark
        eyes were strong indications that they were not human! <span class="future">They were doppelgangers.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        In one corner, a flight of stairs led to a balcony built into
        the catwalk. Several walls surrounded what was
        an office or counting house, which was occupied by little more
        than a table, a chair - and Captain Aerun, shock evident on his
        face as he rose. he wall behind him boasted a shuttered, glass-free
        window.
    </p>
    <p>
        As our heroes burst into the office Captain Aerun did a seemingly
        impossible thing - he flew backward through the window - as if on
        strings and floated gracefully down to the warehouse floor <span class="future">He performed a telekinetic leap.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The encountered devolved into a pitched ranged battle across the catwalks and crates - ultimately Barases summoned a
        crocodile to root the snipers out of their hiding places. With the gang dispatched, our heroes searched the warehouse
        and discovered a hidden trap door leading down into a narrow, stone-walled hallway. Mildew
        darkened the mortar between the bricks and filled the air
        with the damp scent of rot. A steel door, speckled with rust,
        stood at the far end of the hall. It boasted a small barred
        window - through which our heroes saw a dwarf, his flesh bruised and beaten, his hair and beard
        matted with blood, standing chained to the far wall of a
        stench-ridden, claustrophobic cell. It took them a moment
        to recognize him as none other than High Ancestor Durkik
        Forgeheart!
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/High Ancestor Durkik.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        Slowly, as though even so minor a move pained him,
        he looked up to meet their gaze through the bars, his eyes
        widening slightly as he recognized our heroes.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Be careful. The door's trapped. And not to kill you, either.
        They don't want me escaping."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        He gestured with a finger, the chain clinking, to indicate
        a series of tubes that protruded from the walls of the cell,
        pointing in his direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kitara worked for several stressful minutes to disable the spike
        tubes before unlocking the cell and freeing High Ancestor Durkik.
        The dwarf slowly limped from his cell, wincing with every
        step. Clearly he was in a great deal of pain, but despite that
        fact, his eyes were alert.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "Thank you. You're the answer to every
            prayer I've offered Moradin. But I fear, as grateful as I am
            to be out and alive, that I've little good news for you."
        </p>
        <p>
            As you've no doubt surmised, I was kidnapped and held here -
            a doppleganger was sent to take my place and I was tortured to
            provide information to make his impression convincing.
        </p>
        <p>
            These conspirators work for someone called General Zithiruun. I
            haven't seen his face, but he wears a hooded cloak and a strange
            leather-and-steel harness. He questioned me at length - though
            I gave him nothing - but his focus on holding the Stone Anvil
            let me guess what he's after: Mountainroot Temple.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a subterranean structure underneath the Stonehome Mountains built by the same order that
            would later go on to construct the Monastery of the
            Sundered Chain. Built when
            the dwarves were still celebrating their freedom
            from the giants, it was not a dwarven structure, but a
            temple built for anyone who wanted to pay tribute to
            Moradin, of any race. It held great reliquaries of holy
            icons, enormous cathedrals where hundreds could
            worship at once, and even a doorway to the Astral
            Plane whence angels and exarchs of Moradin would
            appear to discourse with the god's most favored
            priests and champions. To facilitate a grand community
            of Moradin worshipers, the Mountainroot Temple
            had, in addition to its astral doors and its main
            entryway into the mountains, four mystical doorways
            constructed. Each linked to another temple of
            Moradin elsewhere in the world, so the faithful could
            come and go with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
            And for decades, even centuries, the temple
            thrived. Slowly, however, relations between
            Moradin's faithful grew strained. Priests assigned
            to other, "lesser" temples grew envious of those at
            Mountainroot. Many of the dwarf faithful grew
            haughty, considering themselves Moradin's "true"
            children, and sought to oust all others, or at least put
            them in lesser places, denying them access to the
            temple's wonders.
        </p>
        <p>
            Was it Moradin's wrath? A curse brought upon
            them by the giants they'd so long ago escaped? Or
            simply a natural catastrophe without greater meaning?
            None can say. Whatever the case, some centuries
            ago, the mountain was struck by an earthquake.
            Portions of the inner tunnels collapsed, damaging
            several chambers of the Mountainroot Temple,
            destroying others entirely. Panicked, the priests and
            the faithful grabbed up their treasures and holy
            icons - at least most of them - and fled using the surviving
            magical portals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once they'd settled elsewhere, the bulk of
            Moradin's priests decided that this way was better.
            By scattering from the temple, they would allow the
            dwarves to build their own shrines, without feeling
            constrained by the other races, and the jealousy
            that marred the priesthood would fade. Although
            they mourned the loss of the great cathedral, and
            those few treasures they'd been unable to save, they
            declared the quake to have been Moradin's will and
            left the temple abandoned. In time, most faithful,
            even most priests save those most thoroughly learned
            in their history, forgot it had ever been.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most, but not all. After a few decades, a small
            group of Moradin worshipers - mostly dwarves, but
            with members of other races as well - returned to the
            Mountainroot Temple. They cleaned it up as best they
            could and vowed to maintain it until it should some
            day become important once again. The most powerful
            of their number took on the title of Caretaker and
            lived within the temple, in a small structure built
            inside the larger reliquary. The Caretaker carefully
            attuned himself to the temple's surviving magic,
            allowing him to control the constructs and divine
            defenses and traps that protected the structure from
            outside invasion.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a member of that order I am one of the few who know
            about the Mountainroot Temple - though I am not the Caretaker and
            as such I am forbidden to enter it. I merely provide the Caretaker
            with supplies. Somehow Zithiruun knows about the temple and was
            questioning me about its magic and security.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you've doubtless guessed, the Stone Anvil contains one of those portals to
            the Mountainroot Temple. I don't know why this General
            Zithiruun wants the temple, but it's clearly what he's after.
            It's funny, he's had me tortured for days to make me
            describe the Mountainroot's mystical defenses, but the
            truth is, I don't know much about them. I know about the
            temple only because, as High Priest, I was told of it by my
            predecessor. I can tell you that the defenses are psychically
            linked to the Caretaker, allowing him to control them, but
            beyond that, I know little. But even had I told them that
            much, I doubt they'd have believed me.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few days ago Zithiruun stormed off insisting he was going to
            'find out for himself.' Chances are that's were he is now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't know why he wants the temple, but I
            know it cannot be good for us. I know not who else in this
            city might have been compromised - who can be trusted.
            That leaves only you.
        </p>
        <p>
            The entrance from the Stone Anvil is carefully hidden
            within an old sepulcher. The chamber is hidden behind a
            secret door; I can escort you to it, but no farther. What I
            cannot do is tell you how to access the portal, for I don't know,
            and I am oathbound never to enter the sepulcher. But my
            hope is that, once you find it, you can figure out how to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I must ask you one thing more. When
            the Mountainroot Temple was abandoned, the priesthood
            took most of our ancient religious relics with them. Most,
            but not all. Somewhere within the temple lies a tome
            entitled, when translated into Common, the Incunabulum
            Primeval. It is a book of great power for those who know
            how to use it. If you can find it and return it to us, I can
            promise you a reward of no less than 3,600 gp from the
            temple treasury, as well as legal right to any other treasure
            you find in, and can carry out of, the Mountainroot."
        </p>

    <p>
        Durkik lead our heroes
        back through the city and the towering halls of the Stone Anvil.
        Several of the priests and guards appeared nervous
        about allowing them to pass, but none were prepared
        to gainsay their guide.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a dozen halls and several wide stairs, Durkik stopped
        inside a great chamber. Shelves of old scrolls lined the stone
        walls, and great marble tables occuppied the room's center. Dust
        lay thick over it all, proving that this room was rarely used.
        For a few moments, the priest fumbled with the scrolls
        on one particular rack. Finally, a loud click resounded
        throughout the room, and one of the walls slid open with
        a deafening rumble and a cascade of powdered stone.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "This is it - the sepulcher. I cannot go any
        farther."
    </blockquote>
    <img src="../tactical/The Portal in the Sepulcher.png" class="left" />
    <img src="../places/The Sepulcher.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        Our heroes were left standing at one end of a long chamber. Chandeliers
        hanging from the ceiling sprang to life even as they passed
        through the secret door, illuminating all that lay before them.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the right and left, stairs led down to an open lower
        level, transforming the floor on which they were standing into a
        central walkway, with two narrower ledges along both sides
        of the room. At even intervals along those walkways the
        floor abruptly widened, almost like the teeth on a gear.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the far end of the chamber, a bright silver filigree of
        unimaginable complexity bulged from the wall. It showed a
        scene of Moradin hard at work at his forge. Four statues -
        two flanking the filigree, two flanking the entrance - showed
        Moradin with a pair of ravens perched on his shoulders.
        Perhaps these were meant to honor the Raven Queen, who
        watches over even Moradin's dead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once they had come closer, our heroes could see an old stone door
        in the wall behind the filigree image. They could not, however, see
        a way to access it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ultimately Kitara touched the filigree in an attempt to get through
        to the door.
        The image suddenly bent as the face of Moradin turned
        toward her and spoke in a voice of rending metal:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Who
        would step through the portal to the heart of Moradin's
        worship must first prove he understands Moradin in his
        own heart.
        Think you carefully on Moradin's precepts, his
        teachings, his actions, and his favored disciples. Then speak
        unto me a parable, a tale of Moradin, not that you have
        learned from his texts, but that you have created yourself.
        Let it show your understanding of his words and his ways,
        and you may pass."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Unfortunately the party's largely atheistic ways left them
        ignorant of the finer points of Moradin's dogma and a magical
        trap was sprung. From the iron image, thin strings of metal - liquid, as
        though melting - shot forth. They struck not at our heroes, but
        at several of the hanging chandeliers, forming a canopy of
        metallic strands overhead. From those chandeliers, great
        lengths of chain dropped to the floor and then reared up like
        striking serpents.
    </p>
    <p>
        After dismembering the chains and rendering the precious filigree
        asunder, our heroes forced their way through the heavy stone door.
        They felt no magic - no tingling or shimmering. It occured
        between steps; one instant, they were in the sepulcher, and
        the next they were...not. They emerged into a great, stone-walled
        chamber. Numerous doorways - many of which were
        contained within deep stone arches, almost like artificial
        caves - provided egress. A platform with multiple stairs
        stood near the chamber's center, presumably for a
        ceremonial purpose long since forgotten. The eastern
        portion of the room appeared to have been largely damaged
        in an ancient cave-in, marring one of two great reliefs that
        adorned the far wall.
    </p>
    <img src="../tactical/Mountainroot Temple.png" class="left" />
    <img src="../npcs/Slystone dwarf ruffian.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        Perched on one of the archways and atop the
        undamaged relief, a pair of foul females with ragged hair
        and the claws and wings of vultures turned piercing eyes in
        our heroes' direction, letting loose with a terrible, predatory cry.
        Only a few yards away, what appeared to be a scruffy,
        abnormally short dwarf <span class="future">slystone dwarf ruffian</span> peered at them between slitted lids.
        From the corner of his eye, Lechonero spotted a second
        thuggish-looking dwarf skulking quietly in the shadows of
        the broken wall.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a quick skirmish with the fey our heroes found they were trapped -
        they couldn't return through the door way they entered through nor any of
        the other portals in the room. Instead they headed deeper into the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
        Passing out of the room and down a narrow passageway they emerged into a
        mostly empty chamber containing a small round table and a few chairs.
        Several cracked teacups and ale mugs,
        covered in dust and cobwebs, stood on the table where they
        were abandoned so long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
        Off through one door, wooden racks lined the walls of the next room, empty and dust-covered. From
        their size and shape, Festivus guessed that they once held bottles
        of wine and kegs of ale.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other door led to a room containing several long tables, capable of seating dozens, stretching the
        length of the room. Chairs were scattered about, some having
        been knocked over or broken just recently. A few humanoid
        corpses - small, with gray skin and wicked teeth <span class="future">quicklings</span> - lay strewn
        about. Of whatever slew them, there was no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
		Backtracking, Lechonero discovered a secret passage from the tea room into an uneven room that was
		clearly a repository of a sort. The
		walls were of heavy stone - heavier, even, than any seen
		elsewhere in the temple - and several short flights of stairs
		led to vaultlike rooms. These separate chambers boasted
		heavy portcullises, though the gates were all raised.
    </p>
    <p>
		Three twisted, grotesque little humanoids, with deadgray
		skin and inhuman features <span class="future">quicklings</span>, dropped the coins they were
		examining as our heroes entered. They were joined by another pair of harpies, skulking just
		beyond two of the entries to the vaults!
    </p>
    <p>
		After a heated combat that ranged across the room (setting off daggerspring floor traps)
		our heroes bested the fey and claimed the riches of the vault for themselves - including
		a wicked looking spiked chain kept under lock and key. Searching the room our heroes discovered
		a secret passage down through a trapdoor but chose to explore the rest of the temple first.
    </p>
    <img src="../places/The Grand Cathedral.png" class="left" />
    <p>
		Returning to exit through the kitchens, our heroes emerged into an enormous area.
		Some of our heroes had seen keeps smaller than the vast chamber
		around them. Roughly oval in shape, save for the crumbling
		walls to the east, the chamber consisted of multiple levels.
		Stairs in the room's center, as well as great sweeping ramps
		around the sides, climbing to the second level 20 feet above.
		One of those ramps had partly collapsed along with the
		walls. Steep stairs and slopes led from there to a third
		level, and a platform not unlike the one in the temple's entry
		chamber stood high atop that. Huge chunks of wall and
		stone stood along the broken edge, forming natural ledges,
		and a deep crevice ran a jagged path to the southeast.
    </p>
    <p>
		The room was filled with malicious fey: another of the vile, bestial-looking dwarves <span class="future">slystone dwarf ruffian</span>
		was hiding in the lee of the stairs. Above, there were several insectoid-featured
		humanoids <span class="future">banshrae dartswarmers</span> perched on various ledges. And there
		were yet more foes - twisted gray
		humanoids roughly the size of halflings <span class="future">quickling runners</span>, lurking around
		various corners and in the shadows.
    </p>
    <img src="../pcs/Smudge.png" class="right" />
    <p>
		After a few moments of combat with the fey,
		a deafening boom rang out over the chamber, echoing
		through the vastness. Twice, three times, and then they heard
		a sudden shattering and the sound of wood rebounding off
		stone as the double doors burst open, and jagged bits of the lock
		hung loose. Through the open doorway barged an array of
		horrific figures: several green and mottled trolls, a pair of
		smaller creatures with similar features and narrowed eyes <span class="future">spitting trolls</span>,
		and - most terrifyingly - a broad-shouldered troll with two
		shrieking heads. Accompanying one of the small trolls was a
		red-scaled reptile on a heavy chain, smoke rising from its
		nostrils and from between its jagged teeth <span class="future">Smudge</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
		In an epic three-way battle our heroes emerged victorious over both
		the fey and the trolls. Lechonero managed to tame the Redspawn Firebelcher
		(over Barases' heated objections) and named him Smudge.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Smudge in tow our heroes headed east through the collapsed tunnels.
        Climbing up from the crevice, they had a brief instant to look
        around. They were in a cathedral or religious sanctuary, far
        smaller than the main one behind them, and the hall boasted
        a dais at the far end, behind which loomed a great relief of
        Moradin at his forge. A line of columns ran down both sides
        of the room; two of the great pillars had fallen, apparently
        toppled in the same cataclysm that created the crevice.
        And then their brief moment of observation had passed, as
        a cadre of one-eyed giants, axes held high, converged on our heroes!
        Joining the cyclops were a handful of gnome-sized fey skulking in the shadows
        <span class="future">slystone dwarf ruffians</span>,
        and another of the insectoid fey <span class="future">banshrae dartswarmers</span>
        crouched upon the steps of the dais, its unblinking eyes
        gazing in their direction.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Hethralga.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        Through the melee Kitara spied an old dwarf crone, ancient beyond belief,
        atop the dais, almost blending in to the relief beyond.
        As the combat began in earnest Kitara and the dwarf locked eye and recognition and
        shock caused the crone to drop her disguise; the dwarf melted away to reveal a
        Howling Hag - and one Kitara recognized from her past as Hethralga "Our Lady of the Deathly Song", a personal
        servant of King Cachlain and a member of the coven responsible for her ritual
        mutilation. Flying into a rage, Kitara charged through the fey directly at Hethralga -
        who began to flee. Throwing spell after spell at everything in her way Kitara cleared
        a path to her quarry and with a final spell turned her into a toad.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a last ditch effort to stop her, the cyclops started knocking over the remaining columns
        in the chamber. A low groan reverberated through the sanctum, sending
        dust raining down from above. And then the rain became far
        more than dust, as bits of rock began to shake loose. Kitara grabbed the toad and dived into
        the next room to avoid the rockslide.
    </p>
    <p>
        With her troops defeated, our heroes subdued Hethralga once she returned to her normal form and
        questioned her. Under threat of being left alone with Kitara, Hethralga revealed that King
        Cachlain had sent her to recover the Incunumbulum Primeval - "a parchment voice" of great power
        that he had sought for some time time. Only recently, however, had she
        learned that its retrieval had become urgent, because
        the court's divinations suggested that someone else
        was about to get their hands on it. She admitted that
        Cachlain's new counselor - someone named Sovacles,
        whom she had never met - tried to talk him out of
        sending them, but that the king was too desperate to
        get the book. She explained that they could not leave because of "the Others" - a band of humanoids
        consisting mostly of trolls - appeared and took the Caretaker prisoner, thus cutting off all
        possible exit. They had been engaging in regular skirmishes with these "Others".
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "They are organized and serve some higher master. But I do not know who. Perhaps they are the reason
        Cachlain felt we must retrieve the parchment voice so swiftly. Now? I seek only to escape the temple. A
        portal to the Feywild stands at the base of the mountains,
        where the waters flow from above to reach the
        plains. I would return home - with the Incunabulum
        if possible, but at least with my life."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Through further intimidation she revealed that she already had the
        tome and exchanged it for her freedom and a pact of non-interference.
		The tome was an enormous book,
		nearly 2 feet tall by 18 inches wide, and almost
		a foot thick. The pages were an incredibly heavy
		parchment, while the cover consisted of thin
		planks of wood that were bound and hinged in
		iron.
		The book was written in Dwarven, but also in
		a sort of cipher; no attempt at translating or
		decoding it functioned without either the proper
		rituals, known only to the priesthood of Moradin,
		or magic more potent than any our heroes possessed.
    </p>
    <img src="../tactical/The Underchambers.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        Wearied from their battles, our heroes retreated to the Underchambers under the Grand Cathedral looking for a place to rest.
        The initial chamber was apparently a foyer or waiting room. A
        ragged rug covered the floor, with a few old indentations
        indicating where chairs used to sit. Through a cloakroom to the northeast
        they entered a room lined with wooden-walled monastic
        cells.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond it lay a
        combination meeting hall and library. A long table sat
        amid a smattering of chairs, and the chamber's western
        side was occupied by a more heavily upholstered chair, a
        bookcase, and a small altar to Moradin. All were covered in a
        fine coating of dust.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last room appeared to be an actual forge,
        which was perhaps used for ceremonial purposes or the
        creation of magic items. Two anvils occupied the room's
        northern side, while a fire pit filled with ancient white-gray
        ashes took up the center of the chamber. Against the south
        wall, a larger anvil stood beneath the unblinking gaze of a
        statue of Moradin.
    </p>
    <p>
        After disarming a magical trap and dismantling some guardian constructs, our heroes secured the area to rest before pressing on.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the Incunumbulum Primeval in hand and the means to their escape clear, our heroes advanced on the
        Reliquary north of the Grand Cathedral where Hethralga said the "Others" and teh Caretaker were based.
        They entered a wide corridor. Ahead of them, two flights of
        stairs, separated by a long landing, led to a platform high
        above. Two figures stood atop that platform, apparently
        conversing. One was a rust-hued dragonborn clad in heavy
        armor. The other was a slender figure, its features hidden
        by a hooded cloak. He was clad in a sort of leather-and-steel
        harness. It looked less like armor than like the creation of
        a maddened surgeon - a full-bodysuit version of a brace
        designed to hold a broken limb in place.
    </p>
    <p>
        They saw them only for a split second, for before the door
        had even fully opened, both had stepped away from the
        edge and out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the top of the stairs four stone stairs came together, forming a small
        platform about 20 feet above a larger, circular surface.
        That surface appeared to be made of glass or crystal,
        allowing a full view of the various chambers below. Some of
        those chambers extended out from beneath the crystal - openroofed
        so that our heroes could still see in. The stairs to the north
        rose upward, rather than down, culminating in a large
        set of double doors several dozen feet above the current
        level, and a pair of massive statues of Moradin stood in the
        northwest and northeast corners. To the southwest stood
        a pair of small buildings - the only structures in the entire
        cavern that appeared to have a roof.
    </p>
    <p>
        An array of humanoid creatures stood scattered about
        the chamber, both on the platform or stairs, and down on
        the ground level. Not a one of them looked especially thrilled
        to see our heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
        A pitched battle ensued between our heroes and some dragonborn gladiators,
        a spitting troll, and a handful of human thugs. An eidolon - a construct
        guardian in service to the temple - <span class="future">confused by the
        tortured Caretaker</span> worked against our heroes. Despite the odds, our
        heroes were victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking for the missing figure <span class="future">General Zithiruun</span>
        our heroes opened the double doors at the top of the stairs.
        For an eternal instant, the world faded away as they stood
        upon the precipice of infinity <span class="future">the Astral Sea</span>. An ocean of pearlescent
        silver stretched ever onward, its tides and crests all but
        invisible as they slowly traversed the great expanse. Beneath
        those waters, stars and constellations twinkled with almost
        blinding clarity, and far in the distance, the great peaks of
        an unknown isle protrude from the endless waters.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sense of vertigo there, at the edge of the world, was
        almost overwhelming, striking not merely at the body but at
        the mind and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
        Turning away from the double doors, the party searched the Reliquary,
        picking through old tapestries, paintings, sculptures, books, and scrolls.
        Most of the artifacts had already been looted.
    </p>
    <p>
        They moved onto the separate building and its attachment. They were the only two structures
        in the cavern to have roofs, and were clearly of far more recent
        construction than most everything else therein. The walls
        were of thin stone and did not match the surroundings, and
        the floor was covered haphazardly with a thin rug. Several
        tables and chairs sat scattered about, and a cooking
        cauldron occupied one corner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apparently a sitting or study room, the chamber contained
        little but old, decaying chairs and a few small tables barely
        wide enough for a large tome.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/The Caretaker.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        What was once a bedroom had been transformed into a
        chamber of horrors. Old blood had matted the carpet into
        a thin film that crunched beneath their feet. Dull blades
        and needles protruded from the surface of a desk, where they
        were apparently stuck for safekeeping. A wooden bed frame
        leaned against the wall at an angle; chained to it, dangling by
        his chafed and bloody wrists, was what appears to be a dwarf
        with hair and beard of writhing flame! Despite its touch,
        the wood of the frame showed no evidence of burning.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a panicked reaction, Kitara magically doused the flames - only for them
        to reignite shortly thereafter as the dwarf turned out to be an azer - a
        race of beings from the Elemental Chaos with fire for hair. Stunned by
        having his hair put out, the Caretaker awoke from his torture-induced
        unconsciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
        While alive, the Caretaker appeared to have been driven mad by the tortures
        inflicted upon him. With a combination of healing from Barases and Festivus
        and gentle coaxing and preaching on the tenets of Moradin they slowly brought
        the Caretaker back to himself.
        The azer blinked once, and when he looked at them again, his
		eyes were clear - or rather, they appeared to burn with an inner
		fire that they lacked earlier. He spoke in heavily accented
		Common.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	    <p>
			"You have my thanks, strangers. You should not
			be here, but as you are - and as I needed you - I will take this
			to be Moradin's will. I know not who these creatures were,
			who invaded my home and dealt so cruelly with me, but I
			know their intentions! I heard them plan! They seek to attack
			the city of Overlook, from both without and - through my
			temple - within! Even though the latter has been thwarted,
			the former might yet lie ahead; Overlook, and indeed Elsir
			Vale, might suffer greatly. But tell me, who are these villains?
			Do you know? Tell me all that has happened, please...
	    </p>
	    <p>
			I knew that the tall one wanted me to turn over
			stewardship of the temple to him. I fear that, in
			my pain, I might indeed have granted him control over
			some of the constructs, but I denied him any more than
			that. I...I fear that when you awoke me from my stupor,
			the portals were instantly unbarred. He has likely fled
			already. But at least I can swiftly return you to Overlook the
			same way...
	    </p>
	    <p>
			I realize time is short, and that you must
			hurry back to warn the people of Overlook. Nevertheless,
			I must ask you...can you spare an hour, and perhaps a
			bit of your hard-won gains, to aid me with one final task?
			After the blood that was shed here, I must perform a ritual
			to reconsecrate the temple to Moradin. I cannot do it alone,
			and if you do not aid me, I will have to walk several miles
			through the mountains to find assistance at Bordrin's
			Watch. Perhaps this sounds to you like the ramblings of an
			old fool, but I believe fully that Moradin will smile upon us
			for doing so."
	    </p>
	</blockquote>
    <p>
    	Our heroes agreed to aid in reconsecrating the temple and spent
    	precious time and residuum to do so. For just an instant, as the
    	last echoes of the rite faded away,
		the entire room grew ever so slightly warmer, as though
		heated from within by the fires of a small forge. The faint
		chime of hammers on steel reverberated from all around
		our heroes, and then once more there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
    	With the portals open, our heroes returned to Overlook through the door
    	by which they had arrived at Mountainroot Temple and emerged back into
    	the sepulcher in the Stone Anvil. Relating all that had transpired to
    	High Ancestor Durkik, the priest took the Incunabulum Primeval from them
    	with thanks and quickly ushered them out to meet a waiting squad of soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
		Durkik and the soldiers escorted our heroes through the streets of Overlook and the gates of the mighty
		Caer Overlook, until finally they reached the imposing doors of the High Hall. Standing
		on the dais in the center of the chamber were three of the
		Council's five members, as well as several more soldiers and
		High Priest Durkik Forgeheart.
		Upon seeing our heroes, Great Elder Morgoff Stonefirst waved
		at them, not to speak to them from below, but to join them
		upon the dais!
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Elder Morgoff.png" class="right" />
    <p>
    	Without a moment to rest our heroes found themselves, along with the present members of the
		council, High Priest Durkik, and several officers, standing in
		a perfectly square room of stone walls. A table in the center of
		the room boasted an intricate model of Overlook, while each of
		the walls showcased maps of the surrounding area.
		Great Elder Morgoff asked Durkik to offer a prayer to Moradin
		to open the meeting. Once done, he said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
		"I was hoping to wait until all our members were present, but we've still not heard
		from Elders Itrika Mountainhome or Olman Sledgemore -
		they are, presumably, occupied with other duties and
		our messengers haven't reached them to tell them of this
		emergency conclave - and we've no more time to wait.
		High Ancestor Durkik, as well as several other citizens,
		such as Priestess Lavinya, have told us a bit of what's been
		happening our city. But I'm given to understand that you
		can tell us far more. Please, what's going on? Is Overlook
		in danger?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    	After our heroes related what they knew Morgoff continued:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
		"Overlook is a
		martial city. We have mighty walls, strong soldiers. But we
		are accustomed to fighting foes such as orcs, not monstrous
		enemies such as trolls, who rise again each time they fall. My
		friends, you have more experience with such things. Will you
		help us plan? And would you make yourselves available to us
		throughout the siege, to deal with such dangers as our guards -
		skilled though they are - are unprepared to face? I offer you
		what reward I can for your help, though I cannot cite you
		numbers or amounts until I see what resources remain when -
		if - Overlook survives the coming days."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    	After long hours planning for the defense of Overlook and the
    	coming attack Great Elder Morgoff's shoulders slumped.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    	"I fear
		we've done all we can for now. We must go
		and spread word to our soldiers of what is to come,
		and what they must do. My friends, if you are willing, I would have you stay here
		at Caer Overlook tonight, so that you are ready on a
		moment's notice. I can have people show you to guest
		quarters. I suggest we all get a good night's sleep; I
		fear the next days will be tiring indeed."
    </blockquote>
    <img src="../places/The Sacrifice.png" class="left" />
    <p>
    	Lechonero went out scouting during the night and spied a mercenary army -
    	consisting mostly of human soldiers and trolls, but with dragonborn and other creatures
		scattered throughout - approaching Overlook from the south. Though he doubted his eyes at first, he
    	also saw a flying ship sailing away in the opposite direction. He quickly returned to Overlook
    	ahead of the army to warn the defenders and our heroes settled in for the night to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
    	They awoke in the morning to the sound of catapult boulders
		slamming against the ramparts, and were swiftly summoned
		to the Council's war room.
    </p>
    <p>
		Although the sentries fearfully reported a large force of trolls and other creatures
		approaching the gates, the army sounded smaller than our heroes had feared.
		Perhaps Zithiruun wasn't able to assemble as many troops as he’d hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
		As they stood in the war room, discussing tactics, a
		messenger barged in and dropped to one knee, panting, at
		Great Elder Morgoff's feet.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		"My apologies for interrupting, but Nine
		Bells is burning! A creature - gods, I've never seen anything
		like them - they're flying over the district and dropping
		alchemical fire bombs! The local soldiers are dealing with
		some of them, but there are just too many!"
	</blockquote>
    <img src="../tactical/Death From Above.png" class="right" />
    <p>
		As they raced through the city toward Nine Bells, our heroes noticed a
		squad of soldiers standing victorious over a band of defeated trolls.
		Durkik stood beside them, his hands flickering with holy fire.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Our heroes rushed to Nine Bells to intercede (especially worried that
    	Amyria might be harmed as she prayed in the Temple of Ioun). When they
    	arrived flames danced across a cluster of rooftops, and the crackling
		from the fire drowned out the screams of panic as citizens
		scrambled in all directions. In the smoky air above, a trio of
		horrid winged humanoids, with mottled blue skin <span class="future">berbalangs</span>, whirled
		about on the inferno-birthed updrafts. Every few moments,
		one of them hurled a clay jug that burst into flames as it
		struck a nearby building.
    </p>
    <p>
    	After shooting down the berbalangs and dealing with the spreading fire
    	our heroes checked in on Amyria only to find her missing! They weren't
    	afforded time to worry however, as a military courier caught up with them
    	and shouted:
    </p>
	<blockquote>
		"The outer wall! They've
		breached the outer wall, just north of the west gate!"
	</blockquote>
    <img src="../tactical/Hold the Wall.png" class="left" />
    <p>
    	Hurrying down to the west gate our heroes arrived at a scene of destruction.
    	Rubble lay strewn about - rubble that used to be a 15-foot
		stretch of wall. Visible just beyond was a huge tree trunk,
		capped with bronze - presumably, the battering ram that
		created the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Moving through the gap were several hideous trolls. The
		city guards appeared to have a few occupied, but others - two
		in heavy armor, one with two heads, and one far smaller
		than the others - were moving unimpeded into the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Barely overcoming the powerful trolls, our heroes received no rest
    	as without warning, they heard Great Elder Morgoff's voice in
		their heads.
    </p>
	<blockquote>
		"Our diviners have located Councilor Mountainhome.
		A siege missile struck her home, which now burns as she
		lies unconscious! Please save her!"
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Farther down the street, our heroes spotted a team of dwarves wearing the
		holy hammer of Moradin. They were charging unharmed through a burning
		building to reach a band of mercenaries threatening civilians. Standing
		behind them, Durkik chanted passages from the Incunabulum Primeval.
	</p>
    <p>
    	Our heroes rushed to the Stonehammer district and found the
    	expensive apartment of Counselor Itrika Mountainhome well
    	and truly aflame. Climbing through upper-story windows and
    	choking through the smoke Karrion and Kallista (naturally
    	resistant to fire) found Itrika's recumbent form and carried
    	her to safety.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Exhausted and drained our heroes retreated to High Hall to rest
    	for the night as the battle continued to rage across the city.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Even as they rose from a night of troubled, martial dreams, a
		knock sounded on their chamber doors. High Ancestor Durkik
		stood outside, looking grim.
    </p>
	<blockquote>
		"I bring word from Councilor Morgoff. In the late
		hours of the night, a squadron of soldiers was dispatched
		to investigate reports of enemies in the streets close to Caer
		Overlook. None have returned. As soon as you've risen and
		readied yourself, I'm to show you on the map where they
		were assigned, and ask you to investigate."
	</blockquote>
    <img src="../tactical/General Zithiruun.png" class="right" />
    <p>
    	Arriving at the scene our heroes found the corpses of dozens of
		Overlook's soldiers scattered around the open courtyard, and across the
		stoops of the nearby buildings. Some were badly burned, some slashed
		to ribbons, and some rotting as though they'd lain dead for
		weeks on end. Two dragonborn in heavy armor waited across
		the courtyard; one stood beside a large, red-scaled reptile <span class="future">Redspawn Firebelcher</span>
		exhaling large puffs of smoke. Hiding amid the rubble and ruin was another
		dragonborn, one of darker scales and armor, wielding a
		pair of broad-bladed daggers.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/General Zithiruun.png" class="left" />
    <p>
    	Shortly after engaging the mercenaries, a horrific boom reverberated from a nearby building as
		a massive beast soared over the rooftop, knocking several
		of the stones from their place. What appeared to be a dead
		dragon <span class="future">Rathoraiax</span>, its scales dull, its gray leather skin showing between
		the gaps, rose into the air on broken wings. The entire top
		of its jaw was missing, showing upward pointing teeth and a
		wormlike tongue that thrashed about with a mind of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
		And riding atop that beast was a humanoid figure <span class="future">General Zithiruun</span> clad
		in heavy hides, contained within a body harness of iron
		joints and leather straps. His limbs and face were gaunt,
		nearly desiccated. Several old wounds hung open, leaking
		trails of blood and puss, showing bare bone in some spots
		and metal plates in others. But despite his old injuries and
		deformities, his narrow features and his yellowed, leathery
		skin clearly marked him as one of the dread githyanki, raiders
		and conquerors of the Astral Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
    	This was General Zithiruun.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The battle raged between the buildings and across the rooftops - arrows and spells
    	exchanged for blasts of poisonous, necrotic gas from his reanimated mount Rathoraix.
    	Zithiruun appeared to glide rooftop to rooftop like a marionette <span class="future">telekinetic leaps</span>
    	and tossing his silver saber to slash at our heroes before magically returning to his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
		As things looked grim for our heroes, for just an instant, as they faced their enemies, they once again felt a faint
		warmth, as of a forge fire, and heard the distant sound of chiming hammers. Their spirits soared with Moradin's blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Though close to death, ultimately our heroes proved victorious. Once word of Zithiruun's death spread through
		the invaders, their attack gradually weakened until
		a cheer arose from the sentries atop the wall, as a force of several
		hundred dwarves from Bordrin's Watch appeared on the western horizon, striking at the enemy
		from behind and driving them back into the wild.
    </p>
    <p>
		For the moment, our heroes had learned that the

		Durkik had experienced a reawakening
		of faith. His time of confinement and torture,
		followed by his rescue at the hands of our heroes and
		his survival of the siege, had caused him to reevaluate
		the previous years. From a beaten-down, tired,
		and increasingly corrupt politician, he returned to his
		younger identity as a devout priest of Moradin. In
		helping to turn him around, our heroes had gained a
		grateful and powerful ally, and they had done great
		good to the religious community of Overlook as a
		whole. This was particularly important, considering that
		the high priests of other temples were suborned by
		the githyanki, and their replacements were all younger
		and inexperienced. Over the next months, Durkik
		emerged as a spiritual leader for the entire city.

		Overlook had weathered the storm,
		and though damaged, the city stood tall and proud.
		The Dusk Wardens were hailed as great heroes, and several different
		establishments offered them free room and board
		for several months. They were invited to dine with the Council of
		Elders several times over the next few weeks.
