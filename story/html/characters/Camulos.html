        A mercenary and a lumbering giant, Camulos defies expectations by having a heart of gold and a nimbleness that belies his size.
        In service to Sarshan he objected too loudly to his employer's unethical practices and was imprisoned for it. Rescued by the
        Dusk Wardens, he now travels alongside them, lending his hammer and shield in their defense.
