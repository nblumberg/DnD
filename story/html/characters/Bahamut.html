        <ul>
            <li>Uphold the highest ideals of honor and justice.</li>
            <li>Be constantly vigilant against evil and oppose it on all fronts.</li>
            <li>Protect the weak, liberate the oppressed, and defend just order.</li>
        </ul>
        Bahamutan priests are called Justicars.
