        Captain Aerun was a dwarf captain of the City Watch in Overlook tasked with overseeing the bolstering
        of the city's defenses in the aftermath of Tusk's invasion and Sarshan's initial plots. Being in such
        a strategic position the invaders under General Zithiruun kidnapped Captain Aerun and destroyed
        his mind with a complex psychic ritual that allowed his body to be possessed by a githyanki. From his
        position of power the githyanki could sabotage any city defenses - old or new - in preparation for their
        upcoming invasion. When our heroes discovered their plot, the possessed Captain Aerun attacked them and
        was destroyed.
