            Kartenix was the captain of the Brindol city guard, father of Thurann. As officiant of the Brindol race
            he and his son were highly visible when Sinruth's troops attacked and both he and his son were kidnapped.
            As the captain of the guard Kartenix felt responsible for his fellow captives and attempted a jailbreak
            that cost him his life.
