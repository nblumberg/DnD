        Andor and Toris Scrollstone were
        sages who specialized in maps and locations. Commonly
        consulted by explorers into the Underdark and
        merchants who had long journeys ahead of them,
        the Scrollstone brothers were the people to consult if
        one wished to learn more about Sayre's undercity.
        They can talk about Auger and its destruction at
        unknown hands. They have old maps showing what
        buildings used to be where. Both dwarves were annoyed
        by the incorrect location of the memorial plaque for
        Auglos' Tower on Prospect Hill.
