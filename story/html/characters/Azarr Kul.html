        Azarr Kul was a half-dragon hobgoblin warrior and a child of the blue dragon Tyrgarun.
        Azarr Kul discovered the Thane of Tiamat (an abandonned temple deep in the Wyrmsmoke Mountains) and converted from worshipping
        Maglubiyet to Tiamat. He united the goblinoid tribes of the Wyrmsmoke Mountains and dubbed them the Kulkor Zhul and adopted the
        standard of the Red Hand (an ancient symbol of Tiamat's cult). Conquering the Wyrmsmoke Mountains he named his kingdom Harg
        Kulkor - "Land of the Dragon." Crowning himself High Wyrmlord he marched his army to conquer an unsuspecting Elsir Vale. The
        adventuring party the Dawn Wardens encountered the army early by happenstance and stymied its advance by collapsing the ancient
        dwarven bridge at Skull Gorge. In the interim they rallied the people of the vale to defend against the Red Hand and ultimately
        assassinated Azarr Kul. Without his leadership his fractuous army split and turned on itself, leading to its defeat by the
        peoples of the Vale.
