        Sarshan was an opportunistic shadar-kai arms dealer and a lieutenant of Sangwyr. For years, he had built an invisible mercantile
        empire around the sale and brokering of weapons, armor, mercenaries, and intelligence from his domain
        of Umbraforge in the Shadowfell.

        He captured Barases while he was searching for his brother Petraynus in the Feydark and imprisoned him in Umbraforge. He also
        imprisoned Camulos as a rogue mercenary in his camps.

        Sarshan was hired by the githyanki to provide a mercenary army and materiel for their attack
        on Overlook and the Elsir Vale. His plans were prematurely exposed when his lieutenant Modra went rogue and sold aid and arms to Tusk and the Orog invasion
        for a personal profit against Sarshan's orders. When the Dusk Wardens took care of Modra for him, Sarshan tried to hire them, but his plans to attack the world
        caused them to turn against him and flee when Modra's sabotage distracted him.

        His base of operations at Umbraforge destroyed, Sarshan turned to his lieutenant Shephatiah and her mining operations at the Karak Lode
        to finance the rebuilding of his empire.

        Following the breaking of the siege of Overlook, the githyanki turned on Sarshan. His base broken, cut off by his former employers, and pursued by agents of
        Overlook, Sarshan turned to a desperate gambit: flooding Elsir Vale with Blood Chaos to eliminate his enemies. The Dusk Wardens tracked the Blooad Chaos back
        to Sarshan at his hideout in the Tower of Djamela in the Elemental Chaos - finally putting the shadar-kai down.
