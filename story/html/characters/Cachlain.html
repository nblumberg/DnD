            Cachlain, the fomorian king, ruled a subterranean
            complex of caverns, much of it chipped from great
            crystals and shaped by cyclops slaves into immaculate,
            enormous corridors and rooms. Cachlain is
            particularly fond of beautiful magical craft, and his
            citadel is filled with arcane torches and doorways
            that open on command. Constructs are his favorite
            marvel, and he has many throughout his realm. Once,
            when the king was in an especially mad mood, he had
            a stone golem pried apart, and its stone armor affixed
            to his skin. This gave him his name.

            Cachlain's onetime advisor, Sangwyr, and Sangwyr's lieutenant
            Hethralga were responsible for kidnapping Kitara as a child,
            performing formorian grafting rituals on her, and training her
            as a bladesinger. In her youth, Kitara believed she had been
            kidnapped by Cachlain, but Sangwyr betrayed Cachlain and cut
            out on his own as a rival warlord.

            Virizan, and exarch of Tiamat, posing as the human Sovacles,
            used enchantments to ensorcel Cachlain and became his
            advisor. Controlling Cachlain's mind, Virizan steered Cachlain
            into aiding the githyanki. From his secluded kindgom, he
            provided transport for the forces of evil. Like the Elsir
            Vale, though to a lesser extent, Cachlain's realm contained
            portals to different planes and locations. Though
            the githyanki possessed many means of transport, the
            Stone-Skinned King's portals were especially worrisome,
            since they connect to lands near several cities of
            the Coalition. The fomorian had established total control
            over the portals, using rituals that took decades to
            take effect; no one passes through one of the portals
            without Cachlain's seal.

            The Gatekeepers' war council found out about the
            troop transports and that Cachlain provided
            the Seed of Winter to the invaders in "Alliance at Nefelus."
            They sent our heroes to stop Cachlain aiding the githyanki
            by any means necessary.

            On their way to see Cachlain, our heroes were waylaid by agents of Inzira,
            who entreated them to negotiate a truce with Cachlain on her behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our heroes discovered, confronted, and defeated Virizan, freeing Cachlain
            from his influence. They negotiated an alliance between Cachlain and Inzira
            against Sangwyr and Cachlain promised to stop supporting the githyanki.
