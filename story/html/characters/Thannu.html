            Thannu was Sarshan's grizzled shadar-kai captain. He had ritual scars standing
            out on his cheeks and two umbral panthers as pets. At first he captured the
            Dusk Wardens and presented them to his boss who offered them a job, but when
            Sarshan left Thannu turned on them sensing their imminent betrayal.
