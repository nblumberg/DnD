            Everyone in Brindol thinks that the crone Zerriksa is a witch,
            but she's really just an accomplished herbalist. She's a naturally cranky
            70-year-old woman who was kidnapped by Sinruth. She played rumours of her "dark powers"
            to her advantage while captive.
