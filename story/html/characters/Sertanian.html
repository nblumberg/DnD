        Sertanian is the castellan of the Hall of Great Valor
        in Brindol and was kidnapped by Sinruth. Sertanian
        weathered his captivity with dignity, and when rescued,
        he brushed off questions about his captivity as "Just
        a few hard days, nothing more." Sertanian has a past - he served
        as a soldier during the great "Red Hand" invasion
        years ago. He has an utter hatred of hobgoblins.
        Sertanian has been responsible for the
        treasures from the Hall of Great Valor for years.
        After his rescue, he took Richard D'Eversholt on as an apprentice
        castellan.
