        One of the leaders of the Githzerai of Sayre. She urges patience and caution.
        She has lived in Sayre for many years, and the recent
        change in public opinion about the city's githzerai
        citizens had distressed her a great deal (although she
        didn't reveal anything but a stoic demeanor openly).
        Aziff had the backing of the other local githzerai and Amyria.
