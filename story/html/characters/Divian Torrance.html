        Lord Divian Torrance was the ruler of Sayre,
        elected by a fellowship of scholars and merchants.
        He was married to Lady Catherine Torrance.
        He was a potent and skilled politician. His goal, first and
        foremost, was to see that his city came out ahead in
        the war. He wasn't willing to side with the githyanki
        invaders, but his goal was to lead the alliance so that
        his small city was given due representation. He knew
        that Sayre's leadership wouldn't have been consulted
        if not for the good fortune of hosting the first meeting
        and the absence of a representative from Nefelus.

        He acquired the position of head of the Gatekeepers through
        political maneuvering, but was murdered by githyanki assassins
        after a short term in office to be replaced by Amyria.
