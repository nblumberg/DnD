        Inogo Dravitch was a dragonborn priest of Erathis. Inogo hailed
        from the distant city of Sherrbyr (Festivus' home). This city lies far
        to the northeast, beyond Elsir Vale by at least three
        weeks' travel. Inogo was the current leader of this city of
        temples. A theocratic city state, Sherrbyr also boasted
        a massive college of divinity, where worshipers of
        nearly any deity could openly practice their faith.
        As a result of its varied populace, the city's leadership
        was formed of a council of priests of the most
        worshiped deities in the city. The council changed as
        the population changed. Some deities fell out of favor
        while others rose. But Erathis's worshipers had been
        a power in the city for years, and Inogo was the most
        recent in a long series of Erathis-worshiping council
        leaders known as Deacons.
        Sherrbyr was a city accustomed to nearly endless
        debate, thanks to efforts to accommodate every faith
        represented on the ruling council. As someone long
        schooled in this approach to government, Deacon
        Dravitch was well out of his league in a group that needs
        to make decisions quickly and decisively. He represented
        a powerful city, however, in terms of both its
        military and divine might. Sherrbyr could field a veritable
        army of healers, as well as a mounted corps of
        paladins. Inogo was mostly quiet in the meetings,
        speaking up only when a plan of action is proposed.
