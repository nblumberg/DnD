            An ancient folk hero among the githyanki and the githzerai, the female battle-thrall Gith led
            her fellow slaves in revolt against their illithid masters. Once free of their shackles,
            a philosphical divide between her people caused the schism into, and subsequent civil war between,
            the githyanki ("Children of Gith") and the githzerai ("Those who spurn Gith").
        </p>
        <p style="display:none;">
            Gith herself is revered by her people, the githyanki, as a martyr.
            Their histories claim she willingly went to serve Tiamat the Dragon Queen in the Nine Hells of Baator
            to secure powerful allies for her people, and to this day githyanki retain something between a
            truce and an alliance with red dragons, in stark contrast to their attitudes towards all other
            forms of sapient life. Her chief subordinate, Vlaakith, who brokered the deal, assumed control of
            the githyanki afterwards, leading them in the plunder and conquest of many worlds from their
            cities on the Astral Plane. Some darkly whisper that Gith's sacrifice was nothing of the kind,
            and that Vlaakith sold her master into slavery in exchange for the secrets of undeath. Her
            descendants, all of them also named Vlaakith, ruled over the githyanki for generations before one
            of them achieved lichdom a millennium ago. Now, she reigns supreme as the Immortal Lich Queen of
            her people, forcing them to worship her to the exclusion of all other divinities as she attempts
            to achieve true godhood. Her paranoia and the cravings of her undead nature drive her to consume
            the souls of any githyanki that grow too powerful, a fate her people are indoctrinated and
            brainwashed into regarding as an honor and a service to their race.

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            So it came to pass that the People had achieved victory over their illithid masters.
            They <i>knew</i> freedom. Yet before the green fires had died from the battlefield,
            Gith spoke of continuing the war. Many, still filled with the bloodlust in their hearts,
            agreed with her.
            She spoke of not merely defeating the illithids, but destroying all illithids across the
            Planes. After the illithids had been exterminated, they would bring war to all other races
            they encountered.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Gith's heart, fires raged. She lived in war, and in war, she <i>knew</i> herself.
            All that her eyes saw, she wanted to conquer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zerthimon spoke the beginnings of that which was against Gith's will.
            He spoke that the People already <i>knew</i> freedom.
            Now they should <i>know</i> themselves again and mend the damage that had been done to the
            People. Behind his words were many other hearts of the People who were weary of the war
            against the illithid.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Know</i> that Gith's heart was not Zerthimon's heart on this matter. She said that the
            war would continue. The illithid would be destroyed. Their flesh would be no more. Then the
            People would claim the False Worlds as their own. Gith told Zerthimon that they would be under
            the same sky in this matter. The words were like bared steel.
            From Zerthimon came the Pronouncement of Two Skies. In the wake of his words came war.
