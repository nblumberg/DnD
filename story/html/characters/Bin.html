            An amensiac doppelganger with a talent for manipulating energies, she awoke with no memory in Nine Bells in Overlook.
            There she was revived, named ("bin" means "empty cup" in Dwarven), and given purpose by the local priestess Aelys, putting her powers of disguise to work infiltrating
            the evil forces working against Elsir Vale. While infiltrating the Wicked Fang tribe she was captured and subjected to
            Fangren's corrupt rituals manipulating enemies from the Elemental Chaos. Rescued before being sacrificed, Bin now continues
            her mission alongside the Dusk Wardens, imbued with the power of the elements by Fangren's rituals.
