            Kyrion was a lieutenant and weapons master of Sarshan's sent to train the Wicked Fang tribe of
            gnolls to use shadar-kai weapons, including the custom-made Wicked Fang blade. Despite his orders
            not to fight on behalf of Fangren, Kyrion was overconfident in his ability to dispatch our heroes
            - leading to his demise.
