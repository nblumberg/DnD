        Son of the late satyr demigod Papposilenus and a druid upholding his father's ideals, Barases Kahler searches for his brother Petraynus - heir to his father's godhead.
        His father's domain has grown increasingly strained and twisted after his passing, rot settling into the heart of the wood. Dutiful and loyal, Barases has ventured
        far from the comfort of the Feywild in search of the prodigal son in hopes of restoring balance.
