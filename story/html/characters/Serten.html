            Serten was the apprentice of Falrinth the sage in Talar.
            He was an anxious, portly human male who
            wore an ink-stained robe. He
            was groggy and bleeding from a head wound caused by
            falling stone and his robes were tattered and torn when our heroes met him.
            He saved the life of Megan Swiftblade, dragging her from his master's collapsing
            tower when she broke her leg defending him from Falrinth's escaped experiments.
