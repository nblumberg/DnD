        Garth is a member of the Brindol watch, young and arrogant
        and was looking to win the Brindol race in order to bump himself up the ranks
        and to impress a girl he likes very much. He was determined
        to win and to show off, taking risks throughout the race. Being a
        local, Garth knew how to push the rules to their absolute
        limit and did not hesitate to do so.
        He wasn't above a little sabotage, either, including spilling
        a bag of marbles behind him to make life difficult for
        those following him, not to mention the public.
