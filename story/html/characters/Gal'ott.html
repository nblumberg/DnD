        Gal'ott is a local leader of the Sayre githzerai.
        An atypically fiery githzerai, he urges action. Young and angry,
        he wants to take the fight to the streets, organizing
        what amounts to a githzerai gang. Gal'ott and several
        other githzerai are refugees from cities and monasteries
        from elsewhere in the world. Many have traveled
        several hundred miles to get to Sayre after seeing
        githyanki destroy their homes, and they're appalled
        that nothing is being done here to combat the threat.
        These githzerai wear red armbands and never travel
        alone, only adding to the local residents' fears of
        exactly what Gal'ott was asking his fellows to do.
