        Richard D'Eversholt is a paladin of Bahamut. A holy vision told him to join the Dusk Wardens on their quest but once he rescued Jalissa from Sinruth
        they settled down together in Brindol. Richard retired to raise their child, assist Sertanian in running the Hall of Great Valor, and found a proper
        temple to Bahamut in Brindol.
