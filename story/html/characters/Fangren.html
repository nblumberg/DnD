        Fangren was a demonic gnoll and chief of the Wicked Fang tribe who plagued the lands around
        the Giantshield Mountains. Receiving aid (in the form of weapons and advisors) from Sarshan,
        Fangren took up residence in the abandoned monastery, Fortress Graystone.
        He attempted to use the planar energies of the Elemental Chaos woven into the place by its
        githzerai creators to perform a ritual that would turn him into an exarc of the demon lord
        Yeenoghu. Our heroes killed Fangren's followers and shadar-kai allies before halting the
        Fangren's ritual sacrifice of Bin and instead channeled the ritual's energies into a ritual
        of their own that released Amyria from her sword. Melvin mysteriously disappeared while exploring
        Fortress Graystone, only to reappear months later fighting the githyanki. Among Sarshan's gifts
        to Fangren was the magical blade called Wicked Fang in honor of his tribe.
