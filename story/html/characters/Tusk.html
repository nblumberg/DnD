            Tusk was an orc leader is an overlarge warrior and chieftain. Not a true orc, he has the blood of
            ogres in his veins, which made him larger, tougher,
            and eminently more dangerous. Having slaughtered
            half a dozen orc chieftains, he drew together the
            unruly tribes to mount an offensive against Bordrin's
            Watch to lay claim to the soft lands beyond its walls.
            Tusk knew the history of the Stonehome Mountains
            well, knowing that unless he could find some way to
            bypass the fortress in the mountains, it wouldn't matter
            how many warriors he commanded since he would fail.
            What Tusk needed was a way around the fortress.
            Ever resourceful and with numerous contacts and
            allies, Tusk turned to his occasional lover and advisor,
            a shadar-kai witch named Myrissa. He sent her back
            to the Shadowfell to recruit allies to help his cause,
            and a short time later she returned with a small army
            of dark ones, led by a mysterious and sinister dark
            creeper, known as the Emissary (Modra). This leader offered
            to assist Tusk in exchange for an exclusive arrangement
            in which they would supply Tusk's armies with
            weaponry for whatever price Modra asked, and in exchange, the dark creepers
            would find a way through the mountains. Tusk readily
            agreed and paid the exorbitant price, gaining a
            fine arsenal, and also, he hoped, the key to victory.

            Not long after, the dark creepers returned and
            revealed a number of tunnels burrowed beneath the
            mountain. They showed the chieftain the locations of
            each, explaining how the passages connected one side
            of the mountains to the other. No tunnel was large
            enough to accommodate his entire army, so, Tusk
            gave his horde their marching orders, sending them
            to climb the mountain slopes, while his scouts moved
            ahead to secure the tunnels and prepare the way for
            Tusk and his elite warriors to strike the fortress from
            below.
