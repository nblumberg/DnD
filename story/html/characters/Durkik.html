        High Ancestor Durkik Forgeheart is the high priest of Moradin in Overlook. During Zithiruun's invasion he was
        kidnapped and held captive while he was replaced by a doppelganger. He was kept alive but tortured
        for information to make the doppelganger's ongoing impression convincing. After being freed by our
        heroes, Durkik resumed his role as head of the church and sent our heroes to the Mountainroot Temple
        to defeat Zithiruun's forces and recover the Incunabulum Primeval.
