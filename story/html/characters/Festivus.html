        Festivus was born the child of a rigid, devout sorceress of Sherbyrr and a society-defying, free-spirited itinerant artisan.
        While she was still young her society drove her father away as an outcast and he disappeared from her life. In return, Festivus rejected
        all the confining restrictions of her childhood when she came of age: her mother's expectations, the conservativeness and
        propriety of her Dragonborn culture - even her gender (she is physically male). Blessed (or cursed) with her father's wanderlust
        she left home to train as a bard where her flamboyant rebellion, cross-dressing fashion sense, and acerbic wit found an
        appreciative audience. She has a talent for appealing to the rebels in restrictive cultures and has plied it with success among
        the dwarves of Elsir Vale. She searches for a way to truly break free of her bonds and fully realize her feminine self.
