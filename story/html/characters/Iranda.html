            Iranda was a shadar-kai witch and a minion of Modra's sent to assist Tusk and Myrissa with their invasion of Elsir Vale.
            She personally killed Jen of the Farstriders but shortly thereafter met her own end at the hands of the Dusk Wardens.
            When Modra fled Sarshan and was trapped in the world he sought out Iranda's portal key (then in the Kitara's possession)
            in order to return to sabotage Sarshan's operations in Umbraforge.
