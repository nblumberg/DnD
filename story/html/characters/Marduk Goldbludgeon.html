            Marduk Goldbludgeon is an accomplished dwarven monk trained in the monastic traditions of
            the githzerai House of Reprisal. A former member of the Dawn Wardens, Marduk retired with his
            wife to Hammerfist Holds. He defended the Holds from a raid by a minotaur tribe from the hills to
            the south  of the Wyvernwatch Mountains. The raid left a child minotaur orphaned in its wake: Melvin.
            Marduk showed compassion to Melvin and raised him as an adopted son. Just before Tusk's invasion of
            Elsir Vale Marduk was called to the aid of his githzerai masters - under attack by the githyanki.
