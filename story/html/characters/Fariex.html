        Fariex the Scalehammer was a tall, richly dressed man with a burnished dark complexion.
        He was a powerful merchant with interests
        in various cities. Fariex did not represent a city
        or other political body, but was invited to the Gatekeepers because of his
        connections to many far-reaching settlements, townships,
        and ports, and the wealth and military might
        they represent.
        He was light-hearted by nature, and knew more jokes
        than most jesters. Far from a buffoon, however,
        he expected respect.
        He was slow to weigh the facts of a problem instead of quickly
        making up his mind.
        Generally quiet, Fariex would occasionally interject a pointed question,
        especially if the topic of conversation touched on his
        area of expertise (namely, money and its movement
        through business affairs). He openly tried to
        catch others in duplicity or engage in some word play
        over a statement he perceived as absurd.
