      Amyria is a mysterious deva dedicated to Bahamut that sprang from a ceremonial platinum
      longsword kept in Brindol's Hall of Great Valor. The longsword was stolen by Sinruth and
      recovered by our heroes. Richard D'Eversholt, a paladin of Bahamut, left the party after
      recovering the sword and became castellan of the Hall of Great Valor. One day the sword
      spoke, summoning the heroes and asking them to stop the gnoll Fangren's dark ritual
      manipulating planar energies and put them to a different purpose: releasing Amyria from the
      sword. Once back in her own body Amyria had no memory and brought our heroes back to
      Overlook where she prayed for guidance before disappearing during the githyanki siege.

      Amyria reappeared in Sayre having brought together various world powers to form an alliance
      against the githyanki invasion. With our heroes' help, she succeeded in forming the Gatekeepers.
      Acting as envoy to the Thraxinium, Amyria and our heroes brought the island nation of Nefelus
      into the Gatekeepers.

      After losses to the Githyanki, Amyria was named the new head of the Gatekeepers.
