            Hethralga was a hag originally in service to Cachlain. She specialized in the
            formorian grafting techniques, splicing physical and magical abilities from one
            creature to another. As part of Cachlain's coven, she and he fellow hags kidnapped
            children of the fey, turned them into formor, and trained them as warriors and slaves
            of Cachlain. Hethralga betrayed Cachlain and began to work in service of his advisor
            Sangwyr instead, building Sangwyr his own personal army. When Sangwyr betrayed
            Cachlain to become a rival warlord, Hethralga went with him.

            During her tenure as a double-agent for Sangwyr while working for Cachlain,
            Hethralga kidnapped Kitara as a child, replaced her eye and trained her in her
            arcane powers. Kitara escaped Hethralga's coven as a teenager before she completed
            her training and could be put to service for Sangwyr.
