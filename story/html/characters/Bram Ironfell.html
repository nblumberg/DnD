            Bram Ironfell was wealthy dwarf, a member of the Elsir Consortium, and a scion
            of Clan Ironfell. He was a well-dressed dwarf wearing
            the rich robes of a successful merchant, his golden
            beard braided with silver bands.

            In the aftermath of Umbraforge Bram approached the Dusk Wardens
            with documents recovered from Sarshan's operation indicating the location of Clan
            Ironfell's long lost mine the Karak Lode. He hired them to find and secure the mine
            so that it's income could help fund Overlook's defense.

            When the Dusk Wardens returned from the Karak Mines Bram agreed to shutter the mines
            rather than risk the danger it presents. He began an affair with Festivus, but disappeared
            from Overlook "on business" for months, straining their relationship.

            In truth, Bram worked as a representative of the githyanki, helping them to invade Overlook.
            Working for the githyanki brought him in contact with Sarshan, where he discovered Sarshan's
            interests in the Karak Lode. Hoping for some personal profit, he hired our heroes to steal
            the wealth of the Karak Lode for him.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the failure of the githyanki attack on Overlook, Bram fell out of favor with the
            githyanki and was set up to die in a githyanki assassination attempt against Cachlain.
            Due to sentiment for Festivus, he changed sides and assisted our heroes against the githyanki,
            but is now a fugitive from Overlook, Cachlain, and the githyanki.
