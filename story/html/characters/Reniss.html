        Reniss is a half-elf ranger and sister to Jen of the Farstriders. She wears brown leather
        beneath a green cloak, and a longbow slung across her chest.
        When Jen was killed Reniss came to Overlook to investigate her murder. She helped put the
        Dusk Wardens on Modra's trail.
