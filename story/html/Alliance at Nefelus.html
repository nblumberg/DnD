  <h2>Alliance at Nefelus</h2>
  <p>
    The island nation of Nefelus, a lush tropical realm
    that has long kept itself isolated from the dealings of
    the rest of the world, had recently found its tranquil
    peace disturbed by a threat that even its deva-led mage
    council (known as the Thraxinium) could not squelch.
  </p>
  <p>
    While Amyria assembled the Gatekeepers, a mysterious ice floe appeared a
    few miles off the coast of the island, and within a few
    days, the warm and pleasant climate of Nefelus began
    to grow colder, threatening the natural order.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nefelus took action as soon as it was apparent that
    the conditions were getting more severe. Endowed
    with a formidable navy to protect themselves from
    pirates and foreign interlopers, the Thraxinium dispatched
    vessels to the ice floe to investigate, and if
    necessary, fight any present threat. However, unusual
    arctic sahuagin attacked the ships. Only one vessel made it to the ice
    floe, and no reports came back from its crew.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several days passed, and the Thraxinium debated
    their next course of action as they did research to
    combat the threat of the climate change. While they
    were preparing their next moves, the magical cold
    emanating from the ice floe intensified and over the
    course of one night, it formed an icy ring that cut off
    any ships bound in or out of the ports. The nation of
    Nefelus was under siege, and the weather was getting
    worse. The ice threatened to continue to spread,
    and possibly engulf the entire island.
  </p>
  <p>
    A few days later, several members of the Thraxinium
    reported that they were enacting a ritual that would
    stave off any further climatic change as long as the
    forces behind the unnatural cold did not greatly intensify.
    Although that bought a little time, it still meant
    that many members of the Thraxinium had to spend
    considerable resources maintaining the ritual just to
    keep the island from being overwhelmed, and the icy
    ring still separated Nefelus from any help by sea.
    Despite being isolationist, several Thraxi (members
    of the Thraxinium) still maintained contact
    with the outside world. Bejam, a deva on the Thraxinium,
    formed a friendship with a deva named
    Amyria. She had been working to convince the
    Thraxinium to join an alliance of the mortal
    realm intent on defeating a githyanki invasion. But
    Nefelus had seen nothing of the githyanki save for
    a single, strange burglary attempt years before, and
    they'd heard even less. Reluctant to get involved, the
    Thraxi, through Bejam, politely refused all Amyria's
    requests. When the Thraxinium ran out of options
    to deal with the threat of the ice blockade, however,
    Bejam turned to Amyria for aid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bejam’s message found its way to Amyria just
    before the Gatekeepers' first meeting in Sayre. After our heroes
    destroyed the Bitter Glass, freeing
    Nefelus became Amyria’s top priority. She approached
    the Gatekeepers and told them of Nefelus’s problems, and
    their need for assistance. The Gatekeepers agreed to send
    Amyria as an envoy to Nefelus in the hopes that aid to
    Nefelus might bring them out of seclusion and into the
    battle against the githyanki. They did so despite the
    protests of the Gatekeeper’s leader, Lord Torrance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Amyria turned to our heroes to accompany
    her to Nefelus. She chartered a ship called Brindol’s
    Pride, a warship flying under the colors of the Gatekeepers.
    Their journey to Nefelus was almost complete. A massive
    bank of fog loomed directly ahead, and the air became chilly.
    A cry came out of the crow’s nest from the lookout.
  </p>
  <img src="../places/Icehome.png" class="right" />
  <blockquote>
    Iceberg to starboard!
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Looking to the right, our heroes saw a gigantic,
    shadowed mass far off in the fog, it stood at least 100
    feet tall.
  </p>
  <p>
    They continued on, the waves licking at the hull of the ship,
    and then finally, after a few more cold hours, the fog began to
    lift and they saw a thick ring of ice floating up ahead. Smaller
    chunks of ice, some the size of large wagons, bobbed up and down
    in the water near the ship. Just as the
    ice ring became clear and the captain was preparing to ram, our heroes noticed
    several large forms became visible through the mist.
  </p>
  <img src="../tactical/Blockade_Run.png" class="left" />
  <p>
    Several frost giants took form out of the freezing fog.
    Some wielded enormous frozen greataxes and others drew
    back frosty bows with ice arrows. They wer epositioned on
    the ice ring, where they were preparing to attack, while the
    ship continued to move toward the ice at ramming speed!
  </p>
  <p>
    After a rushed battle defending the Brindol's Pride as it
    crunched through the ice, our heroes broke free on the far
    side and sailed on through the cold and fog for another mile or so.
    Abruptly, the fog lifted, the sun shone, and they were awash in
    the steamy heat of a tropical paradise.
  </p>
  <img src="../places/Nefelus/Nefelus.png" class="right" data-slides="../places/Nefelus/Nefelus.png" />
  <p>
    As the ice rapidly melted off the ship’s bow, they saw a city
    rise before them, clinging to the massive cliffs of an inlet.
    All around them in the bay, fishing boats and naval vessels
    meandered about, clinging close to the shores. Many more were
    docked along the cliff shores. Switchback stairs, walkways,
    and small wooden buildings dotted the lush cliffsides. At the
    far top of the cliffs, hundreds of feet in the air, larger wooden
    structures were packed tightly together, huddled close to
    the cliff’s edge and away from the dense rainforest that
    surrounded the city. At the horizon, a great domed structure
    rose above all to dominate the skyline; from the distance, it
    looked like a temple or perhaps a university.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the ship approached the dock, Amyria briefed our heroes on the
    history of the island:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The Nefelese don't
      have many visitors from the mainland, and it is both
      an honor and a privilege to be allowed to enter as
      guests. The Nefelese have remained isolationist for at least the last
      two centuries, having little contact with the mainland.
    </p>
    </p>
      The Nefelese have lived on this island for as
      long as anyone can remember, and in times past, they
      used to trade and relate to the other nations of the world.
      However, a threat from the Elemental Chaos more than
      two centuries ago almost destroyed their idyllic culture.
      They blamed the other civilizations for their ignorance, and
      after ensnaring the threat and locking it away in the world,
      withdrew almost all ties to the mainland.
    <p>
    <p>
      Nefelus is both the
      name of their capital and nation, and few other
      settlements are on the island. The nation is ruled by a council
      of deva mages called the Thraxinium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nefelus has one of
      the largest known contingents of devas in the world. Some
      say that almost the entire island is sacred ground and most
      devas reincarnate here. All citizens of prominence are devas.
    </p>
    <p>
      They believe that knowledge and
      magical prowess are the two greatest attributes an
      individual can possess. Their ancient and massive Great
      Library, which also serves as their governmental seat,
      university, and temple to Corellon and Ioun, is said to
      contain secrets long lost to the rest of the world.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Once the ship was docked, our heroes left the mundane tasks to
    the crew and departed with Amyria into the wondrous city of
    Nefelus. Scaling up the sides of a verdant cliff dotted with
    buildings that smell like fish and the salty spray of the sea,
    they reached the top and were nearly lost in the crowded, busied
    masses of people moving about. Even in the midday sun,
    the crowds moved rapidly this way and that, but they always
    appeared to be aware of our heroes' presence and never bumped or
    brushed up against them.
  </p>
  <p>
    They continued to make their way through the wooded
    streets, rife with the sounds of conversation, the chatter of
    tropical birds, and the constant whispering of the breeze
    through the exotic trees. After navigating through this
    urban maze for well over two hours, the entrance to the
    Great Library was before them.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Here we are. We’re
    to meet one of their council in the entry hall. His name’s
    Bejam. Let’s go upstairs and see if we can ask around for
    him.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    They climbed the hundreds of stairs to the domed complex’s yawning gate.
    Inside a great entry hall stretched on for what seemed like hundreds
    of feet. Each direction was dotted with multiple hallways and
    doors leading farther into the complex. Above, they could see
    the beautiful blue sky streaming through the glass dome,
    but they were certain that from the outside, the dome looked
    like it was crafted out of wood. In the center of the hall, a
    hundred-foot-high orrery depicting the planes and the world
    gleamed in the sun. The surfaces in the orrery’s universe shifted
    and moved, as though alive with activity.
  </p>
  <img src="../npcs/Bejam.png" class="right" />
  <p>
    Just as they came to the realization that the stifling,
    humid air had abated, a male deva dressed in a shimmering
    blue-violet robe with small platinum wings adorning his
    back approached. He smiled at the retinue and said:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Welcome to Nefelus, our most honored guests. I am
    Bejam, Sixth Thraxus and Keeper of the Mirrors. It is good
    to see that you arrived without much delay. Amyria, I will
    take you before the Thraxinium to discuss the specifics of
    our situation. As for your retinue, I will have an attendant
    escort them to a waiting room where they can rest. I am
    certain we will have need of their expertise soon enough.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Following protocol, he wanted a meeting with Amyria
    first. After his initial introduction, Bejam motioned to
    another deva in the chamber, and exited with Amyria,
    leaving our heroes to be escorted to a well-appointed sitting
    room where they could rest. They were told by the
    attendant that it would be some time, and they should
    rest if they could.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a long wait and numerous inquiries as to their food
    and beverage preferences by the attendant, Amyria and
    Bejam arrived in the sitting room.
    Amyria spoke:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    After long discourse and debate, I
    have talked on behalf of the Gatekeepers and we’ve entered an
    arrangement with the Thraxinium. If you assist Nefelus in
    shedding its problem, they have agreed to at least support
    the Gatekeepers with material and knowledge. My friends, I
    must ask you to once again imperil yourselves for the good
    of our cause. I will let Bejam give you the details that have
    recently become known to me.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Amyria nodded at Bejam and exits the room as the Thraxus begins to brief them:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Through the Thraxinium’s research, the heart of this
      problem appears to bear the mark of an artifact known as
      the Seed of Winter. When properly harnessed by a creature
      attuned to it, the artifact can cause drastic localized climate
      changes and can even alter creatures that come in contact
      with it or are near it. However, we think what’s happening
      to Nefelus goes beyond the normal power of the artifact;
      someone or something must be augmenting it in some way.
      The Seed of Winter was thought lost to the Feywild
      centuries ago, but it has apparently made its way back into
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Thraxinium knows through divinations and other
      more mundane observations that the iceberg that appeared
      out in the sea is the source of the emanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before the ice ring completely blockaded our ships,
      we sent out three ships to investigate the iceberg and
      attempt to deal with the problem. We monitored their
      progress, and two of the three ships were attacked and
      destroyed by sahuagin with ice-blue skin. They appeared
      tougher than normal sahuagin and had an affinity for the
      cold. The last ship limped to the shore of the iceberg and
      was under assault by frost giants there; we saw only one
      survivor make it away from the vessel—a githzerai mentalist
      named Uarion. We have not heard from him since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uarion has been with us for several decades; he is the
      only githzerai in the city, but he proves his worth to Nefelus
      time and time again through his mastery of the powers
      of the mind. He soaks up knowledge like a sponge, and he
      is probably the most accomplished nondeva ritualist in
      Nefelus. It would be a shame if he was lost to the power of
      the Seed.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Asked about his title as the Keeper
    of Mirrors, Bejam responds:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    I am the caretaker of our network of our silver mirrors,
    which are communication devices that we have planted
    throughout the world to keep informed of what’s happening
    on the mainland. We currently set the communication to
    receive only images and speech, so our observations remain
    unnoticed. To the untrained eye, a silver mirror can appear
    as a large mundane item, so its presence is easy enough
    to conceal. Over the past few months, however, we have
    noticed that many of our silver mirrors out in the world
    have gone missing, and until this crisis reared its head, it
    was my primary concern.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    After having finished the briefing, Bejam concludes his
    talk with and said:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    We need your assistance to stop the
    climate change from overwhelming our island and to break
    the blockade. From the estimates made by the Thraxinium,
    we have about a day before our ritualists can no longer
    sustain the magic holding back the freezing weather. Once
    the ritual gives way, the island’s climate will be forever
    altered and many creatures here will die. Nefelus will suffer
    a corruption the likes of which we have not been threatened
    with for hundreds of years. I implore you to journey to the
    iceberg and end this assault on our way of life. If you can
    bring back the Seed of Winter for study and find out the
    fate of Uarion, all the better. Amyria says she has not met
    any more accomplished at dangerous tasks than you. Will
    you assist us?
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Once our heroes agreed to help Nefelus out,
    Bejam escorted them out of the sitting room into the
    entry hall where they met up with Amyria. He
    provided provisions and ice shoes to the party.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Amyria in tow, Bejam escorted the group down one of those
    mysterious hallways that lead farther into the Great Library.
    At the end of the hall, a spiral staircase lead down into the
    darkness. As they descended down, softly glowing orbs affixed
    to the walls lit their way. The stairs continued for hundreds
    of feet. Eventually, they came to a door with a strange series
    of sigils on its face. Bejam softly intoned some words and the
    sigils flashed. He opened the door, revealing a workshop with all
    sorts of tools and arcane objects lying about on various tables.
    Beyond the workshop, the cavernous room was what
    looked to be a dock, but no tunnel led out into a waterway.
    Floating in the pool were three curious objects; they looked like
    giant silvery lobsters with glass windows where their eyes
    should be. They could see seats and a number of levers through
    the windows; these appeared to be a sort of vehicle.
    Bejam explained that those three vehicles are known
    as apparatuses of Kwalish, named after the wizard that
    invented them. He then continues to brief our heroes on
    their mission:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      When we realized that the first ships were
      attacked and the ice ring blockaded us, we
      prepared these vehicles for use. They are
      submersible craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are to pilot the apparatuses of Kwalish to
      the iceberg so they arrive without much notice.
      The previous attempts at traveling by ship and
      the presence of the ice ring make conventional
      means of getting there riskier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each apparatus can carry two people. One of the
      two needs to be piloting at all times; the other
      should keep lookout and can operate the claws
      if needed. The vehicles are equipped on the
      lever console with a homing arrow that has been
      attuned to the iceberg such that the arrow always
      points toward the iceberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should take approximately 3 hours to reach the
      iceberg from here. The vehicles are easy enough
      to pilot. You need to surface the vessels after you
      arrive so that the air can be replenished; there’s
      only enough air in one of these to take you there.
    </p>
    <p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Bejam gave our heroes a quick course in piloting
    the apparatus and then assembled the party
    at the dock.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    I have two more items for you to take with you.
    I am certain that they will be of aid to you on the mission.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    He produced a small flickering prism and a scroll tube from
    his robe.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      This object is called an elemental prism. We know that the
      Seed of Winter grants creatures under its influence resistance
      to cold attacks, and the prism allows the user to circumvent
      such defenses while providing the user with protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ritual inked on this scroll is called Solace Bole.
      It will transport you to a small secluded place in a pocket
      plane where you can rest and regroup. Time will pass
      normally there, but when you return, only an hour will have
      gone by. With the short amount of time we have before our
      defenses are shattered, you might find this necessary.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    As our heroes piled into the submersibles, Amyria asked them to reopen the hatch. She leaned in
    and said quietly:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    One last thing before you leave. I think
    that it might be possible to convince Bejam to join the
    Gatekeepers as a representative of Nefelus. I will stay here
    and attempt to work toward that goal, but ultimately it will
    depend on the success of your mission. May the platinum
    dragon bring justice to our enemies.
  </blockquote>
