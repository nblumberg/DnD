    <h2>The Siege of Bordrin's Watch</h2>
    <p>
        The lands west of the Stonehome Mountains have been a festering mire of want and suffering. 
        This parched and barren landscape is suited only for orcs, goblinoids, and other fell creatures. 
        From time to time, a warlord gathers a small army and tumbles
        out of these badlands to test their strength and arms
        against the stalwart dwarf defenders, but never have
        they crossed the mountains because straddling its
        single pass is an ancient dwarven stronghold named
        Bordrin's Watch. No matter how many orcs muster,
        they die upon its walls, painting the sturdy stone
        with their black blood. So the rumors of a new host
        in these forlorn bogs and dead woods seemed a small
        threat - nothing the guardians could not handle. This
        army, though, was different. Unlike all the many times
        the orcs have emerged, they now had a leader who
        could keep them together long enough to win.
    </p>

    <p>
        The orc leader was an overlarge warrior and chieftain
        named Tusk. Not a true orc, he had the blood of
        ogres in his veins, which made him larger, tougher,
        and eminently more dangerous. Having slaughtered
        half a dozen orc chieftains, he drew together the
        unruly tribes to mount an offensive against Bordrin's
        Watch to lay claim to the soft lands beyond its walls.
        Tusk knew the history of the Stonehome Mountains
        well, knowing that unless he could find some way to
        bypass the fortress in the mountains, it wouldn't matter
        how many warriors he commanded since he would fail.
        What Tusk needed was a way around the fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ever resourceful and with numerous contacts and
        allies, Tusk turned to his occasional lover and advisor,
        a shadar-kai witch named Myrissa. He sent her back
        to the Shadowfell to recruit allies to help his cause,
        and a short time later she returned with a small army
        of dark ones, led by a mysterious and sinister dark
        creeper, known as the Emissary - <span class="future">later our heroes discovered this to be Modra, a rogue lieutenant of Sarshan</span>. This leader offered
        to assist Tusk in exchange for an exclusive arrangement
        in which they would supply Tusk's armies with
        weaponry for whatever price the dark creeper and
        his fellows asked, and in exchange, the dark creepers
        would find a way through the mountains. Tusk readily
        agreed and paid the exorbitant price, gaining a
        fine arsenal, and also, he hoped, the key to victory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not long after, the dark creepers returned and
        revealed a number of tunnels burrowed beneath the
        mountain. They showed the chieftain the locations of
        each, explaining how the passages connected one side
        of the mountains to the other. No tunnel was large
        enough to accommodate his entire army, so, Tusk
        gave his horde their marching orders, sending them
        to climb the mountain slopes, while his scouts moved
        ahead to secure the tunnels and prepare the way for
        Tusk and his elite warriors to strike the fortress from
        below.
    </p>
    <p>
        War approaches. A week ago, a call to arms sounded
        throughout the Elsir Vale, summoning warriors to help
        defend Bordrin's Watch in the Stonehome Mountains far to
        the west. Word of an army of orcs on the march had spread
        through the Vale for months, but now, it appeared the
        rumors were true.
    </p>
    <img src="places/Overlook.png" class="right"/>
    <p>
        Our heroes, along with militia groups and other adventurers
        from all over the Vale, marched west until they came to
        the city of Overlook, a large fortified community raised
        by dwarves centuries ago. 
    </p>
    <img src="npcs/The Freeriders.png" class="left"/>
    <p>
        Once there, our heroes and two other adventuring parties (the Farstriders and the Freeriders)
        were invited to Caer Overlook and the High Hall, there to attend the Council of Elders. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Standing on the 20-foot tall dais are the
        five elders. Each of the three male dwarves have long
        beards that hang to their feet, and two are old, being
        gray and wrinkled. The third is younger, with black
        hair and hard features. The two female elders are
        both attractive, one with red hair and the other with
        brown. All five wear the robes of their office - luxuriant
        purple and silver damask. Arranged beneath
        them, filling the chamber completely, is a motley
        crowd of common soldiers, militia, and adventurers,
        with each race and occupation represented, and most
        standing in small groups, but a few mingling.
    </p>
    <p>
        The youngest male elder spoke:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Welcome to High Hall friends. I am Elder Cadrick. I don't
            much see the point in bandying words, so I'll lay it out for
            you. War is upon us. A great host of orcs comes from the
            west. Their intention is clear. They will come through the
            mountains bent on slaughter. Those they spare can look
            forward to a short life of slavery. Overlook, and Bordrin's
            Watch in the mountains, have long held fast against these
            raids, but our scouts say never has such an army gathered.
            Thus, we turn to you brave souls to help defend not only
            Overlook, but also all the Elsir Vale.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the orcs arrive, we're certain they will come up
            through the pass. We know this because already there have
            been attacks from the tunnels below, compromising the
            fastness. The defenders have fought back the savages, but
            it's clear the rest are coming and fast.
        </p>
        <p>
            So here's the plan. Durkik Forgeheart will lead the
            militias and most of you to bolster Bordrin's Watch. Orc
            trailblazers infest the tunnels below, so we've tasked their
            security to the Farstriders. One more mission remains,
            though. We need a group to evacuate the monastery on
            the other side of the mountains. It's dangerous work, what
            with the orcs and all, but priests need a warning of what's
            coming if they don't know already.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do we have any volunteers?
        </p>

    <p>
        From Elder Cadrick our heroes learned the Bordrin's Watch had already been compromised - 
        advanced parties of orcs had uncovered the tunnels
        beneath the mountains and were already coming through            
        to harass supply trains and reinforcements bound for the
        fortress. The Council asked our heroes and the other groups to
        descend into these tunnels, clear them out, and seal them
        off before the main host of the enemy army arrived. For
        their efforts, the Council promised to pay each group 1,000
        gp upon their return. Our heroes headed to the old Monastery
        of the Sundered Chain to the southwest, where they
        could gain access to the tunnels below, while the Farstriders heads
        for Bordrin's Watch to secure those passages, and the Freeriders
        to the Vents.
    </p>
    <img src="npcs/Kalad.png" class="left"/>
    <p>
        At the Monastery of the Sundered Chain our heroes overcame a small contingent of Orog before descending into the depths below the upper temple.
        Fighting past elite troops lead by the champion Og while Festivus surfed down a subterranean cliff face on her disc, 
        the party closed the tunnels the orcs were using and rescued the few remaining survivors hiding in the works 
        including the paladin Kalad. Kalad had already closed the tunnels under Bordrin's Watch when the orcs approached, but his unit was overwhelmed attempting 
        the same here. Despite his injuries Kalad insisted our heroes accompany him directly to the Vents to make sure the last tunnels are sealed, doubting the 
        Farstrider's success at the task:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        There's too much at stake, friends! It's a labyrinth down there [at the Vents], easy to get turned
        around. Would you risk the lives of everyone in that
        valley on the efforts of just one group?
        How can we forget the suffering of our kin during the Age of Chains? How can we
        set aside those ancient grudges when the risk of slavery is now greater than ever?
        Fellow warriors, the orcs are upon us, marching once more to the beat of the giants'
        drum. It falls to us to stop them - to hold fast no matter their numbers. If we falter,
        we give into fear. It's not just ourselves and our way of life that will suffer; all people
        of the Elsir Vale will perish as well. War is upon us. Now is the time for men and
        women of courage to stand up and defend those who cannot defend themselves.
    </blockquote>               
    <img src="tactical/The Vents.png" class="right"/>
    <p>
        Following Kalad, our heroes head to the Vents to back up the Farstriders. Scattered across the lower slopes are numerous steaming
        fissures, some as small as tiny cracks in the stone with
        others large enough to accommodate an ogre. The rocks
        there are slippery and aside from ropes of brown-black
        fungus, moss, and lichen, nothing lives here. The air stinks
        of sulfur and grows stronger nearest the plumes of acrid
        smoke wafting up from the holes.
    </p>
    <p>
        About a hundred feet down from the lowest cracks was
        a campsite. There, our heroes saw five horses tied up and empty
        feedbags hanging from their heads. 
        Putting his tracking skills to work Lechonero found a smothered 
        campfire sat a few yards away from the horses and five different 
        sets of footprints leading into one of the larger openings with no sign of any prints coming out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Karrion's keen sense of Dungeoneering led the party successfully through the warren of natural caverns 
        leading to the Vents proper. There the doors opened on a platform overlooking an enormous
        chamber. A group of orcs turned to face our heroes, growling with
        rage and drooling with anticipation for the kill. Behind and
        below the orcs lay a sunken section of the chamber, where
        iron tubes as tall as a man ran across the room.
        Iranda - a dark creepr wearing a long black cloak - was
        examining an iron wheel connected to the southern pipe.
        On the north side of the pit several large beetles milled about,
        their mottled hides glowing red as if aflame.
    </p>
    <p>
        After dispatching the opposition, our heroes recovered an odd brass key from Iranda's body.
        Searching the area, the ill foreshadowing from the campsite proved true as they discovered 
        the bodies of the Farstriders - partially eaten by the orc's pet cave troll. 
        <span class="future">Jen, the half-elf warlock of the Farstriders was killed by Iranda herself.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Nexus of the Vents was a massive chamber in which
        the ceiling rises 100 feet above the entrance. At the
        center of the chamber was a pillar of solid
        steel that was screwed into the stone and that
        stood as tall as the ceiling. Two bronze and
        steel pipes emerged from the eastern walls
        and traveled toward the steel column before
        vanishing into the stone. Rising around
        the outside of the room was a stone catwalk
        that connected to steel grating that wrapped
        around the steel pillar like scaffolding.
        Dark tunnels pocked the walls, leading to who
        knows where. The faint odor of sulfur
        permeated the room and the stone around the base of the
        steel column was dark, as if damp.            
    </p>
    <img src="images/The Nexus.png" class="left"/>
    <p>
        As our heroes ascended the ramps around the outside of the room 
        waves of orcs began pouring from the tunnels to block their path. 
        Melvin charged ahead, sweeping orcs off the edge to their deaths, 
        but was brought up short as the leaders of the invasion - 
        Tusk and Myrissa themselves - emerged from the tunnels and Tusk 
        quickly left Melvin unconscious and bleeding out. Lechonero made a 
        daring swing across the room to rescue Melvin. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Trapped by a seemingly endless horde of orcs, our heroes activated the release 
        mechanism at the top of the Nexus, quickly flooding the chamber with a flood of 
        boiling water stored from the vapor of the Vents and effectively sealing the tunnels. 
        But the mechanism also locked the escape hatch at the top Nexus and our heroes had to race against time to 
        puzzle out the dwarven runes to unlock the hatch and escape before they boiled alive.
