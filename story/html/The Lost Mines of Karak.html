    <h2>The Lost Mines of Karak</h2>
    <p>
        Previously our heroes thwarted the dark creeper Modra and hamstrung his boss Sarshan's blackmarket arms and mercenary business in Overlook. Sarshan spoke vaguely of a
        looming threat to the world and possibly Overlook in particular and our heroes turned over what evidence and information they had gathered from their journey to Sarshan's
        lair in the Shadowfell.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result of saving the city not once but twice, the
        party have become well known in Overlook. This
        notoriety saw them approached by Kalad, the dwarf
        paladin they rescued from the Monastery of the Sundered Chain. In
        the aftermath of the thwarted orc raid, Kalad has taken
        up a position as a sergeant in the Overlook watch. It
        is official business that brought him to our heroes that day, where
        he asked them to meet with a member of the Elsir Consortium.
        Later that day, Kalad escorted them
        to a private room in an upscale Elftown tavern. There,
        he introduced them to a well-dressed dwarf wearing
        the rich robes of a successful merchant, his golden
        beard braided with silver bands.

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "Greetings, Heroes of Overlook. I am Bram Ironfell of the
            Clan Ironfell and representative of the Elsir Consortium.
            Your reputations precede you, and for your actions, you
            have my personal thanks in addition to that of the city. I
            have a tale I wish to share with you, over dinner and drinks
            of course.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city of Overlook stands at the base of the Stonehome
            Mountains at the farthest western reaches of
            the Elsir Vale. This age-old redoubt was the center of
            the ancient dwarf-kingdom that once dominated the
            vale, but which faded into obscurity generations ago.
            Though little is remembered of this lost kingdom,
            its folk ventured far and wide in their day. One dwarf
            clan - the Ironfell - made forays in search of mineral
            wealth in the deserts beyond the Thornwaste to the
            southwest of Elsir Vale. There, they established a
            mine they called the Karak Lode, after the first dwarf
            of Clan Ironfell to fall in its defense.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over long years, Karak became a legendary source
            of wealth as its folk pulled rich deposits of gold, silver,
            and other precious metals from beneath the desert
            sands. A supply depot was established at the desert's
            edge to service the caravans traveling between the
            mine and Elsir Vale, but the location of the Karak
            Lode was kept a closely guarded secret. Only oathsworn
            members of Clan Ironfell ever made the final
            leg of the journey across the sands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dwarves hold their secrets close, and their grip
            is doubly tight where wealth is concerned. So it was
            that Karak's secrecy eventually became its downfall.
            Under the pressure of monstrous marauders, famine,
            and migrant human tribes, the dwarf kingdom of
            Elsir Vale declined. As its resources were taxed past
            the breaking point, the kingdom's borders began to
            contract until little more than the territory immediately
            surrounding Overlook was left. In time,
            sandstorms struck the southern wastes and the Karak
            supply depot was abandoned. Soon, all contact with
            the mine was lost, and the Karak Lode was consigned
            to history.
        </p>
        <p>
            The location of the Karak Lode was known to few even
            within the clan, and it was thought that all who had such
            knowledge were lost when the mines were reclaimed by
            the desert. Even within the clan, Karak is all but forgotten.
            However, recent events might change that.
        </p>
        <p>
            The destruction of Sarshan's operations in Overlook
            saw the shadar-kai's many warehouses and transit
            points raided. In one of those raids, the watch uncovered
            documents connected to Sarshan's operations, including
            an ancient fragment of parchment I understand we have you to thank for. On it was written a
            list of landmarks and bearings for a journey, along with
            the name of Clan Ironfell. I had never seen this parchment
            before. However, at the watch's request, I undertook a bit
            of research into my family's archives. If what I discovered
            there holds true, this parchment holds the directions to the
            Karak Lode.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discovering what became of my kin would end a sad
            chapter in Ironfell history, but that is not my primary
            motive in seeking your aid. If the Karak Lode can be found,
            its wealth offers the means to shore up the defenses of
            Overlook and the Elsir Vale. However, it is anyone's guess
            what manner of creatures might lair there, or what defenses
            the last of the clan left to guard the mines. This is not a job
            for the city watch, I fear.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a mission for
            heroes who have shown
            their mettle in the
            defense of others.
            If the evidence you have
            uncovered is true, the
            Siege of Bordrin's Watch
            was but the first sortie
            in a larger campaign,
            against which Overlook
            and Elsir Vale cannot
            stand for long. I will tell
            you of the Karak Lode,
            and of lost wealth with
            which we might defend
            our land against the war
            that is coming."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Bram offered the pary 1,000 gp (half in gold, half in
        gems) as an upfront payment for undertaking the
        search for the Karak Lode. In addition, the party could
        claim any other treasure they recovered along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following the directions to the Karak Lode, the
        party first headed south across the Thornwaste that
        stretches between Elsir Vale and the Stonehome
        Mountains.
        South of the Westdeep, the broken ground of the Thornwaste
        stretches before them. Ridges of knife-edged stone spread as
        far as the eye can see, interspersed with heavy growths of
        twisted brambles. Their first investigation of them reveal that
        their thorns are iron-sharp, capable of drawing blood even
        through the thickest clothing. No trail or tracks lead into the
        wasteland ahead.
    </p>
    <img src="BASE/maps/Clan Rivals.png" class="right"/>
    <p>
        Deep in the Thornwaste a crossbow appeared over the crest of a large outcropping just beyond a ravine
        ahead, trained on the group. A
        scuffling to the east revealed another dwarf bolter rising
        from behind a hedge of screening brambles.
        Suddenly a gang of dwarves from Clan Hammerfist - a rival to Clan Ironfell -
        attacked the party. They fell before our heroes' might but did manage to
        disorient the party.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lost in the Thornwaste, our heroes spied a human male in a tattered black coat
        and leggings slipping through the brush and brambles. A battered, wide-brimmed hat shrouded his face,
        his boots held together with coarse twine. He carried a spear
        in one hand, a leather-bound book in the other.
        This was the ranger Mag Blackthorn, and Lechonero nearly shot him with one of his infamous "warning shots."
        After demanding a duel to satisfy his honor, Mag graciously escorted the party to the settlement of Dunesend
        as the only civilization near our heroes' route.
    </p>
    <img src="BASE/maps/Dunesend.png" title="Dunesend" class="left"/>
    <p>
        After a four-day journey our heroes arrived at the village of Dunesend which marks the frontier of two
        equally desolate lands. To the north lies the forbidding
        Thornwaste, across which only the most experienced -
        or most desperate - explorers tread. To the south,
        endless desert dunes march to the far horizon.
        Dunesend was built on the ruins of the dwarven
        supply depot that once served Clan Ironfell's hidden
        mining operations in the desert. All that remains of
        the original dwarven enclave are scattered foundations
        and a single watchtower. However, the dwarves'
        carefully constructed system of spring-fed wells and
        cisterns still functions, allowing those who dwell here
        to farm the scrubland and eke out an existence in the
        harsh landscape.
        In years past, trade caravans made Dunesend a
        waypoint along an east-west road that ran along the
        ancient, pre-dwarven, basalt block wall carved in the
        form of a serpentine creature with a crest running down its back.
        Today, the road
        is sand and the caravans have all but vanished. The
        handful of families remaining in Dunesend do so
        because they have nowhere else to go.
    </p>
    <img src="BASE/npcs/The Warden.png" title="The Warden" class="right"/>
    <p>
        As our heroes approach the edge of the village a rustling in the thorny bracken revealed the
        presence of a creature ahead. Lechonero caught a glimpse of a bearded face, its forehead
        marked with goat's horns. It snarled as it turned and raced
        away to the south, quickly disappearing within the briars.
        They crested a low rise to see the expanse of thorns suddenly
        end, a great sea of sand beyond it. At the transition from the
        Thornwaste to the desert, a decrepit village sprawled, its huts
        and fields spreading to either side of an ancient stone tower.
        A sudden cry of pain drifted toward the party on the wind.
        In the center of the settlement, sun-darkened human villagers
        observed in angry silence as a massive gnoll raised a bloodflecked
        flail over its head. At its feet, a human male lay dead.
        Behind the gnoll coiled a serpentine creature with glittering blue
        scales and dozens of legs. It watched the villagers hungrily.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our heroes rushed to the aid of the villages, dispatching the demonic gnoll and his pet behir.
        As the patrolling satyrs came to the aid of the gnoll, the party's newcomer Barases revealed
        himself as a satyr to negotiate. After a tense standoff where most of the party briefly turned
        against Barases, he managed to diffuse the situation and convince the satyrs to stand down.
        The satyrs informed our heroes:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "That creature was the Warden, like us, he served
        Shephatiah, Queen of the Drylands. The blue worm was his steed
        and enforcer.
        The Warden was here to make his monthly collection
        of tribute."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Barases offered to pay the tribute in the villager's stead and compensate Shephatiah for the loss
        of her servant the Warden. Barases asked permission to pay homage to the queen in person and the satyrs
        said they would ask her leave and return with the answer in a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
        The villagers were noticeably cool toward our heroes, and when Lechonero maked one faux paux too many the
        group exiled him from Dunesend while they tried to talk to the townsfolk.  On his own, Lechonero stumbled upon
        the ruins of the ancient dwarven cistern the village was built on - providing an explanation for the giant
        shield wall separating the tiny hamlet from the vast desert.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally an elderly villager named Darkus Comahni moved to claim the
        body left by the Warden and in his grief consented to talk with our heroes:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "The queen's wrath will surely come down on us. Where will you outsiders be then, I wonder?...
        </p>
        <p>
            The Warden was a foul tyrant that serves
            the Queen of the Drylands. The blue worm has slain several among us in recent
            months. The others were creatures of the Thornwaste in
            league with the Warden. They are the ones that prevent us
            from fleeing this place or seeking aid for our plight.
            Poor weather has delayed our crops, but the Warden
            accused us of holding out. He used poor Vaudnim to set an
            example for us all...
        </p>
        <p>
            The Warden first appeared from the desert a year ago,
            stating that Queen Shephatiah had come to reclaim her
            ancient throne. The name meant nothing to us, but the
            Warden slew several of our strongest when we stood against
            him. Now he orders us to pay tribute in goods and food or
            his blue worm will devour us.
        </p>
        <p>
            The satyrs live within the Thornwaste along the desert
            frontier. Like the shifter brigands of the desert, they have
            eagerly pledged themselves to the Warden's service. The
            Warden comes always from the desert to the south. Where
            his queen is, we do not know, but he and his followers
            carry no more than a few days' water to get here. A few
            of our folk tried to follow the Warden's trail when he first
            appeared, but they never returned. All I can tell you is that
            the Warden came once with a shifter who spoke out loud
            of returning to somewhere called Karak. This creature was
            soundly beaten by the Warden for his slip."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        With the mention of Karak, our heroes decide to follow the satyrs directly
        rather than wait for their return. Setting out from Dunesend, the group made their way
        into the desert. Though the arid sands are inhospitable,
        their hard-packed dunes made for easier going
        than the Thornwaste.
    </p>
    <img src="BASE/places/IronfellFortress-long.jpg" title="Fortress Ironfell" class="left"/>
    <p>
        As they traveled, the intermittent desert landmarks they
        passed were a perfect match for the course set out by Bram Ironfell's
        directions. They were a scattered series of basalt pillars, the
        remnants of long-ago volcanic eruptions rising now like
        sentinels from the sand.
    </p>
    <img src="BASE/tactical/Desert Patrol.png" title="Desert Patrol" class="right"/>
    <p>
        On the second day of travel, a figure emerged from a haze of wind-blown
        sand. The emaciated form of an elderly human female
        crawled toward our heroes on hands and knees, her face lined and
        sunburned beneath the hood of a ragged cloak. Her voice
        raised against the wind, she called out:
    <blockquote>
        "Turn back! Nothing
        but death awaits you in the heart of the desert!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Before they reached the woman to assist, our heroes spotted a cloaked form lying on the ground a short distance
        behind the old woman, all but invisible beneath a thin layer of sand. With their ambush foiled,
        several bestial humanoids rose suddenly from the ground, the
        layer of sand that concealed them streaming down their mottled
        brown cloaks. They wielded razor-sharp short swords, snarling
        as they attacked.
        At the same time the old woman's form shimmered like heat haze. In her place
        stood a wizened hag, pointed teeth bared in a hideous
        smile as she laughed.

    <p>
        The day after defeating the patrol sent out by Queen Shephatiah, early that morning, the course they had been following
        became a rocky track leading toward another basalt bluff
        in the distance. However, as the track curved around to its
        south side, they saw two guard towers of hewn stone set into
        the face of the bluff. The narrow gouges of arrow
        slits flanked a narrow track leading directly into the rock.
        Though worn by long years of sand and wind, the towers
        were clearly of dwarven construction, standing as strong as
        the day they were built.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fortress guarding the Karak Lode consists of two
        levels within the basalt bluff, plus a lower level that
        hides the secret entrance to the mines.
        The basalt bluff is 50 feet high, and from its top,
        there is a view of the desert for several miles in every
        direction. Fireplaces and braziers within the complex
        are vented to chimneys that route through narrow
        cracks and crevices, formerly making entry from above impossible
        while the fortress is inhabited. However, in the long years since the mine was
        lost, a collapse on the bluff above had created an
        entrance into the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
        The darkened entry corridor extended inward between rows
        of arrow slits. At the far end, a massive stone gate banded
        with iron stood closed. Halfway along the corridor, a
        rusty portcullis blocked further movement. The sand that
        had drifted in to cover the corridor floor was well marked by
        recent footprints and signs of heavy objects being dragged.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dark figures loomed on the other side of the closest
        arrow slits, silently watching our heroes and giving off a foul odor.
        On closer inspection, the unmoving figures were crudely
        made straw dummies, old dwarven helms on their heads and
        ancient polearms lashed to them with rope. Sneaking past the dummies
        our heroes stumbled upon the troglodyte guards that had set up the stand-ins while they relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having finished off the troglodytes, our heroes also dispatched several
        off-duty shifter guards, one lounging around the dungeon stairs, some in their bunks -
        and one Karrion shot on the shitter.
    </p>
    <p>
        From there our heroes explored the abandoned upper floors of the fortress, before descending
        the rear stairs into the Great Hall. The heavy scent of decay was sharp there and the hall
        was filled with Sussur trees - strange trees of the Feydark with
        silver-gray bark and gnarled branches that rose almost to the
        ceiling, their thick roots punching down into the stone of the
        floor.
        Atop a 2 foot high dais to the north, the eladrin Queen Shephatiah sat upon
        an ornate marble throne carved with bas-reliefs of dwarf miners at work.
        Five human brigands and a shifter warrior stood arrayed about her.
        The decomposing corpse of a villager from Dunesend lay at the queen's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Barases, knowledgeable about fey glamours and nobility, saw through
        the illusion upon "Shephatiah" and guessed her to be a dark dryad in a
        magical disguise rather than a true eladrin noble.
        As if a veil had been lifted, he saw through the corporeal
        disguise of the eladrin queen, revealing the foul humanoid
        plant creature beneath, her feet turning to roots digging deep into the body of the villager.
        Exposed, the imposter and her guards immediately attacked, joined by giant Cacklefiend Hyenas
        from the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having defeated the false queen and her minions, our heroes exited through the courtyard.
        The ceiling of this huge pillared chamber had collapsed, a
        great pile of sand collecting near the east wall. Three sets of
        doors exit this area, arrow slits lining the walls high above.
        Suddenly a massive carrion crawler erupted from the pile of sand
        and a flight of harpies descended from the hole in the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
        A desperate struggle ensued as our heroes tried to shut the doors on the carrion crawler while it
        paralyzed them and the harpies magically charmed them to walk into the crawler's
        maws. Half the group retreated to the upper levels to fire arrows down into the courtyard through
        the arrow slits while Melvin kept leaping off the pillars to pluck the harpies out of the air.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having cleared the fortress, our heroes proceeded to the lower level. Bypassing an animated steel
        cobra guardian and dispatching a lesser berbalang haunting the Ironfell crypts, our heroes discover the dungeons.
        The ancient dungeon showed signs of recent use, with scuff
        marks along the floor indicating traffic in both directions.
        Four large cells stood in the center of the chamber, the
        entrance of each blocked by a lowered portcullis controlled
        by a nearby winch and pulley. From the darkness
        came a bright chirping sound.
    </p>
    <p>
        The southwest cell was occupied by an aged human
        male, his lined face sporting a snow-white beard to
        match his fringe of hair. He wore the garb of a simple
        desert peasant, and appeared to have not been there
        long. Seven yellow canaries perched on his shoulders
        and hopped around his cell. The Birdman whistled and
        chirped at his tiny charges. When spoken to, he simply nodded
        and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
        The prisoner offered no resistance and allowed himself
        to be led upstairs where our heroes secured a room to rest for the night.
        He accepted food and water, smiling when spoken to but otherwise ignoring
        the party as they went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
        Several hours later our heroes were awakened by the rattling of a portcullis
        being raised, only to find the bird man gone. Searching the
        fortress they discover that the path they followed to the fortress around the bluff was gone, swallowed
        by a raging sandstorm. They are forced to take shelter in the empty fortress, but before retreating Lechonero noticed
        something on the sand-strewn floor past the portcullis:
        Humanoid tracks had been laid down by bare feet, a telltale
        yellow feather trodden beneath them. The Birdman appeared
        to have left the fortress, setting out into the deadly storm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as our heroes were about to go back to sleep, the silence was shattered by a frantic chirping. The
        Birdman's canaries were nowhere to be seen, yet their shrill
        warning echoed from the stones.
        Thanks to the warning, our heroes spotted sudden movement at the arrow slits along the south
        wall. Three gray-skinned creatures with long, spindly arms
        were squeezing through the narrow gaps and a hulking troglodyte with a skull mask and staff bursts through
        the east door, another gray-skinned choker behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
        After defeating the would-be ambushers our heroes immediately sought out where they came from. They assumed
        the fortress was completely cleared and the with storm preventing anyone from arriving from outside they reasoned
        the attack must have come from inside the fortress. A thorough search of the fortress led our heroes back to the
        dungeons. The solid floor of the southeast cell newly contained a perfectly
        round hole at the head of a smooth-walled shaft leading
        straight down. Below the floor, an aging pulley system
        descended into darkness. The pulley raised and lowered an
        8-foot-wide wooden lift platform that sat then a few feet
        below the hole. The battered platform was emblazoned with
        the faded crest of Clan Ironfell.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the lift our heroes enter the Karak Mines proper and dispatch more troglodyte guards.
        Once inside actual mineshafts they see that within the damp gray stone of the cavern walls, a faint
        light pulsed. On close examination, they saw veins of dark red
        twisting through the stone of the walls and ceiling, glowing
        with a dull light. Drawing on her Dungeoneering knowledge Karrion identified that this phenomenon
        wasn't a known Underdark substance and Kitara used her arcane knowledge to identify it as raw elemental
        energy that had somehow leached into the natural world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recent tracks along the main passageway led our heroes on.
        The central caverns they passed through showed signs of recent
        mining activity, though on a much smaller scale than the
        dwarves' operations of old.
    </p>
    <p>
        While following the tracks, a vast gallery opened up where the dwarves of Ironfell
        once worked, their long-rotted bodies now scattered across the cavern.
        The rickety remains of ancient ladders and carts
        were spread across the cavern. One prominent vein of the
        strange, red-glowing stone crossed the chamber's floor and
        climbed its walls, its cold light pulsing brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here and there, dwarf skeletons were strewn across the rocky
        ground, rusted weapons lying nearby. The dwarves of Karak
        appeared to have slain each other in the end. Oddly, however,
        many of the skeletons appeared to be missing their skulls.
    </p>
    <p>
        A small horde of enemies prowled the cavern - a barlgura,
        several Bloodweb Spider swarms, a Chillborn Zombie, and two more Carrion Crawlers.
        Using her invisibility, Kitara snuck into the cavern and repetitively
        drew off individuals to be slaughtered by the party waiting in side passages.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final cavern in the mines was circular, showing signs of excavation on
        its far side. However, the way ahead was blocked by a wide
        crevice that pulsed with a lurid red glow - a rift to the Elemental Chaos. In the shadow of
        that light stood two red-skinned demons, slashing the air
        with three-clawed hands. Behind them were piled hundreds
        of dwarven skulls, a gruesome bier on which coiled a
        serpentine creature with a humanlike face: the real Queen Shephatiah - a Guardian Naga.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a bitter battle with Shephatiah, her Mezzodemon guards, and a fire elemental
        summoned through the rift our heroes emerged triumphant.
        Searching the chamber revealed
        a set of scrolls holding parchment correspondence
        written and transported by the naga's mezzodemon
        lieutenants. The missives were in Deep Speech,
        and detail how Shephatiah discovered
        the portal leading to the Karak Lode on a sojourn
        within the Elemental Chaos. They also made reference
        to the reopening of the mines being financed by
        a group that the scrolls did not name. These unknown
        masters had claimed the wealth of the Karak Lode for
        themselves, and were having that wealth shipped to them
        by way of the elemental rift. While the parchments
        indicated that this group intended to ramp up production
        in the mines in response to an increasing need for ore,
        the cryptic notes indicated that Shephatiah herself did
        not know the identity of those she worked for.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a long trek back to Overlook, our heroes relayed
        their findings to Bram Ironfell. The dwarf was disheartened
        by the news, and he told them that he would
        leave the mines closed in order to prevent others from
        suffering the fate of his clanfolk who perished there.
    </p>
    <p>
        Festivus entered into a torrid affair with Bram Ironfell following
        our heroes' return to Overlook, but it was only a few months before
        the business of the Elsir Consortium called Bram away from the city.
        <span class="future">Festivus has had no word from Bram in the months since.</span>
