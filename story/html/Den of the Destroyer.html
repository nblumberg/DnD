    <h2>Den of the Destroyer</h2>
    <p>
        While recuperating from their trip to the Karak Mines, 
        The day was dreary, the sky threatening rain. Suddenly a voice
        called out, and they turned to see a familiar face: Kalad 
        <span class="future">from the Siege of Bordrin's Watch</span>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Word on the street is that someone's looking for you. A
        messenger from Brindol. She was in the market, asking
        everyone in earshot if they knew you. She said her name
        was Alys, sounded desperate."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        When they went looking for Alys, they found that she had gone missing:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Alys you say? That girl from Brindol, said she was looking for
        them that put down the orc raid? She passed this way an hour ago,
        but I saw her go off with some of them Lost Ones. They seemed a
        little too happy to see her, if you know what I mean."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The underworld guild the Lost Ones had kidnapped Alys. Assuming her to 
        be a compatriot of our heroes they intended to pump her for information to 
        help the Lost Ones bring them down in revenge for their prior defeats 
        <span class="future">and to collect a bounty set on our heroes' heads by Sarshan</span>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While tracking the Lost Ones back to their lair in an abandoned temple of Pelor in Nine Bells, 
        our heroes came across a heavily armed elf sitting casually on
        the slanted eaves above the door of a nearby building. The
        elf wore a patch across one eye, appraising our heroes carefully
        with the other.
    </p>
    <img src="npcs/Gilgathorn.png" class="left"/>
    <blockquote>
        "I'd be careful if I were you. The Lost Ones aren't going to be gentle
        when you find them. They've got reason enough to kill you,
        even if you didn't have a bounty on your head. The name is Gilgathorn, 
        Thorn to my friends. 
        I'm a mercenary by trade."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        After flirting with Kitara,
        Gilgathorn confirmed that the Lost Ones were behind Alys' kidnapping, 
        that they sought revenge on our heroes, and that an unknown individual 
        had set a 1,000 gp bounty on our heroes' heads. <span class="future">In truth, 
        Gilgathorn Was a bounty hunter trying to cash in on the bounty himself. He had 
        figured out that Sarshan was the one posting the reward and that the party is 
        dangerous enough to require preparation. He was hoping the Lost Ones would 
        weaken our heroes enough that he could take them - and be on hand to assist our 
        heroes if necessary to prevent the Lost Ones from getting the bounty.</span>

    <img src="tactical/Abandoned Temple of Pelor.png" class="right"/>
    <img src="npcs/Alys.png" class="right"/>
    <p>
        Parting ways with Gilgathorn our heroes entered Nine Bells, the rain that has been threatening
        all day beginning to fall. By the time they located the temple
        of Pelor, the streets were all but empty, the inhabitants of
        the district fled to shelter. From the outside, the temple
        entrance was set above a short flight of stone stairs. The flare
        of lightning shows where relief carvings once adorned the
        temple's outer walls, but these were unrecognizable after
        years of neglect and abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inside the temple, water covered the cracked marble floor where broken
        freestanding frescoes blocked four doors in the far wall.
        Rain poured down through a square opening in the ceiling,
        shards of stained glass clinging to its edges. Beneath it, a
        young woman in tattered traveling garb had been gagged,
        blindfolded, bound to a wooden chair, and apparently alone. 
        However, well-gnawed bones spread across the room and
        the reek of wet fur showed the presence of dogs somewhere
        within the temple. And a flash of lightning through the open ceiling
        revealed faint movement behind the frescoes, figures
        lurking there.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our heroes turned the Lost Ones' ambush into an ambush of their own,
        dispatched the Lost Ones in the temple with overwhelming force 
        and rescued Alys. She was beaten but recovers quickly, determined to show her 
        strength. She spoke with the measured countenance of someone
        reciting a memorized message:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Greetings from Richard D'Eversholt,
        castellan of the Hall of Great Valor. I beseech you to return
        to Brindol with all haste, as your presence is needed here.
        The matter concerns one of the relics that we recovered
        while saving our town's captives in Rivenroar, and is most urgent."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The journey from Overlook to Brindol was relatively
        uneventful. However, as our heroes' approached the point
        where the Dwarf Road meets the Old North Road at
        the foot of Lake Restin, they encountered a band of
        soldiers on patrol. They were stopped for questioning,
        but their names were quickly recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
        The leader of the patrol identified himself as
        Zoram Splintershield, a dwarf whose folk dwell in the
        foothills of the Giant's Shield. He and his troop were
        patrolling the roads around the lake and the Blackfens.
        Zoram told our heroes that in the past few weeks,
        there had been a number of unprovoked attacks and
        abductions in the north of Elsir Vale. Though patrols
        like his scoured the roads in search of these bandits,
        they have so far come up empty.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, Zoram informs our heroes that the abductions
        seem to be perpetrated by gnolls, who have
        traditionally stayed well clear of the vale. Our heroes report seeing
        no sign of gnolls during their time on the road. 
        As such, Zoram bid them a safe journey
        to Brindol, but warned them to keep a wary eye out for
        any trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
        The journey to Brindol took a little over a week.
        Arriving late at night, our heroes found the Hall of Valor
        closed up tight, Alys told them that Richard
        likely had already gone to bed at his home outside
        of town. However, the party's arrival was noted by Mirtala's 
        niece. She invited them to dinner and offered
        comfortable lodging. While speaking with Mirtala she said:
    </p>
    <img src="npcs/Mirtala.png" class="left"/>
    <blockquote>
        Things have been quiet in Brindol since that awful
        business, all thanks to your brave efforts, again and always.
        Still, there's families packing up and taking to the road,
        more and more each week. There's talk of gnolls attacking
        settlements in the north, and word of the orcs rising up in
        the Stonehome. Dark days are coming, or so it seems.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The next morning, our heroes made their way to the
        Hall of Great Valor to meet Richard.
        The Hall of Great Valor was as they last saw it, its glass
        cases lining the walls with relics of Elsir Vale's past. Three
        freestanding displays showed off artifacts of the vanquished
        Red Hand of Doom, a large map of the surrounding lands
        updated with details of the Hand's most recent forays
        against Elsir Vale and its people.
    </p>
    <p>
        A heavily pregnant Jalissa stood dusting relics in a display case across the room,
        and upon seeing our heroes called into the back room. Richard D'Eversholt stepped out to great 
        them, smoothing out his stained smock as he bowed: 
    </p>
    <img src="npcs/Jalissa.png" class="left"/>
    <img src="pcs/Richard D'Eversholt.png" class="right"/>
    <img src="tactical/The Hall of Great Valor.png" class="left"/>
    <blockquote>
        "My friends. Welcome back to Brindol. Thank you for your 
        quick arrival."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Though friendly and showing several extra pounds of contented family life, 
        Richard D'Eversholt was obviously uneasy. Only after locking the doors of the hall did 
        he tell the party why he has summoned them there:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "You recall the platinum blade that was one of the treasures
        taken by Sinruth and his hobgoblin horde. Upon its return
        to the hall, it seemed none the worse for its ordeal. It is a relic
        of some worth and sentimental value, but holds no magic
        that I or any of my predecessors here have noted. But then a
        week ago, while working late at night, I heard a voice, calling
        me. From its case, the sword spoke to me, beseeching me to
        summon heroes to its aid. It asked for all of you by name."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Richard D'Eversholt explained that after the sword began speaking,
        he removed it from its display case and hid it
        in the hall's back room. He led our heroes to a cluttered
        workspace, where the platinum longsword
        lay beneath a cloth on a table. When the cloth was
        removed, without warning, the small workroom is filled with
        a woman's voice, weak: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "You have come, my heroes,
            but my thanks must be brief. I am Amyria, and I have
            summoned you here from great need. I know it must seem
            strange to hear me speak, but I assure you that this form
            is only temporary. It is for that reason that I beseech you
            for your aid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Decades ago, a race of monastics born of the Elemental
            Chaos established a fortress in Elsir Vale. These were the
            githzerai,
            who lived secretly in their remote outpost before
            suddenly vanishing. Their Fortress of Graystone was well
            hidden, and remained uninhabited for long years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some months ago, Fortress Graystone was invaded and
            claimed by a pack of gnoll mercenaries calling themselves
            the Wicked Fang. Their leader, a sadistic follower of the
            demon lord Yeenoghu, has begun to send his raiders out
            into Elsir Vale and beyond. In recent weeks, this gnoll
            chieftain Fangren has managed to open a conduit of
            power to Yeenoghu's realm in the Elemental Chaos. He
            plans to claim some small fragment of the demon lord's
            power, transforming himself into an exarch of the Beast of
            Butchery. It was the creation of this conduit that awoke me
            from my age-long slumber.
        </p>
        <p>
            If Fangren completes his ritual, demonic forces
            will have gained a foothold in the mortal realm. More
            importantly, that conduit to the Elemental Chaos can be
            manipulated through a ritual that I will provide to you.
            This is the boon that I pray you grant me. Bring me to
            Fortress Graystone and free me from this prison.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ritual will free me from my current form, restoring
            me to my rightful body. I can say no more than that.
            Though I am granted the power to speak to you, my
            memory has been fractured by long years of sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            In opening the conduit to the
            Elemental Chaos, Fangren unwittingly set the stage
            for my restoration. The ritual will alter the conduit
            such that it can channel energy from other planes to
            fuel my transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Wicked Fang tribe
            is not to be underestimated. They are strong and
            steeped in demon worship. While making your way
            to the fortress will almost certainly be dangerous, the
            threat to Elsir Vale and the wider world is great.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fortress is built into the side of a peak
            of the Giant's Shield. No roads or trails travel to the
            fortress, so the journey will be arduous.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alas, I cannot tell you more. When the rift was opened, Fangren's
            thoughts and plans came to me as in a dream that
            woke my own mind. I have not seen him since, and
            my spirit grows weaker with every hour that passes.
            Before long, I fear that my voice and thought will be
            lost once more.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        A sudden crash from the hall outside was punctuated by an
        explosion of fire. A burning bottle had been lobbed through
        one of the hall's windows, shattering to spread flaming liquid
        across tables and display cases. A moment later, the locked
        front door was kicked open, a squad of armed figures bursting in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Quick thinking and reflexes - along with the unexpected assistance of 
        Gilgathorn - led our heroes to defeat the attackers 
        and extinguish the flames before any more damage could be done to the 
        Hall.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "I was just passing through Brindol on my way to a job in Marthton 
        when I saw the burning hall. Much to my surprise I saw the lovely Kitara 
        inside and I could not in good conscience deny her a helping hand. I can 
        only assume these are professional bounty hunters. After your run in with 
        the Lost Ones in Overlook I heard rumors that your bounty doubled in the 
        aftermath."
    </blockquote>
    <p class="future">
        Gilgathorn was shadowing our heroes and eavesdropped on their talk with 
        Amyria. Coincidentally Gilgathorn knew Fortress Graystone and subsequently 
        headed there to set traps to weaken them and ultimately ambush them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The journey to Fortress Graystone was well off the established
        trade roads and trails of Elsir Vale, but our heroes' journey 
        there was relatively uneventful.
        On the last day, thick forest had been giving way to rolling
        foothills. The hills rose to a sudden wall of rocky peaks
        rising high above the trees. A rough gravel path wound its
        way along the base of the mountains, the first sign of a true
        trail seen since the departure from Brindol.
    </p>
    <img src="tactical/Fortress Graystone.png" class="right"/>
    <p>
        Fortress Graystone sits built into the side of a low
        peak of the Giantshield Mountains. The structure
        is well hidden from the eyes of the inhabitants of Elsir
        Vale, as was the intention of its builders. 
        <span class="future">The githzerai 
        built Fortress Graystone to protect a thinning
        between the Elemental Chaos and the world.</span>
        A massive stone staircase leading into the side of the 
        mountain is the only entrance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortress Graystone reflected the aesthetic of the githzerai
        who built it, demonstrating balance between the
        chaos of their birthplace and the order they sought to
        impose upon their own lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fortress takes its name from the distinctive
        gray stone found in this area of the Giantshield Mountains,
        colored that way by prevalent veins of platinum ore.
        The stone walls of the fortress are decorated with bas
        reliefs and carvings that have withstood the passage
        of years with little deterioration. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A massive stone staircase rose against the cliff face, 
        narrowing as it reached a set of double stone doors set into
        the rock wall. Four large statues, each depicting a githzerai
        warrior in full combat regalia, stood on pedestals watching
        over the entrance to Fortress Graystone. A small waterfall
        flowed down the side of the mountain, eroding a stone
        balcony set further up the cliff face and leaving the stone
        steps slick and treacherous.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our heroes fought their way up the stairs in a frontal assault, 
        battling gnolls and summoned stone spirits that animated the 
        statues.
    </p>
    <p>
        Past the guards and the stone doors was a wide octagonal chamber. 
        On five of the walls, portals glowed and pulsed with
        arcane energy. The far side of the room appeared to be made
        of extremely thick glass, revealing a second chamber beyond
        with four portals on the wall. A massive circle of carved
        runes dominated the floor of the first chamber, while a
        smaller circle adorned the floor of the room beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
        This turned out to be a disorienting portal room built by the 
        githzerai as a mental exercise. By studying the markings in the 
        room Melvin realized that his master Marduk Goldbludgeon had tough him in the 
        githzerai monastic tradition. Using his mental training he successfully 
        navigated the party through the portals while remaining behind to control 
        them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Past the portals, at the bottom of the second staircase was a crescent-shaped
        chamber set with three doors, its walls and floors stained
        red-black with dried blood. The stench of rot and filth was
        overwhelming, thankfully as it allowed our heroes to sneak up 
        on the gnolls there unaware as they argued among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our heroes took one look in the adjoining room: 
        The ceiling of the huge chamber rose some 60 feet
        overhead. The sound of rushing water sounded out faintly,
        a meager reflection of its source - a waterfall descending
        from an opening in the ceiling to a pool set within a raised
        platform. Two stone gutters carried water down from the
        pool into channels in the floor, creating small rivers that
        flow through circuitous paths in the ground with great
        speed. Every few seconds, the noise of stone on stone
        sounded out as these aqueducts in the floor shifted to follow
        a new path.
        Promptly our heroes declared it to be a trap and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following the hall to its end, the foul scent of gnoll assaulted our heroes the moment the door
        was opened. The massive chamber was once decorated with
        bas-reliefs, now crumbled and defaced by the marks of
        weapons. Crude practice dummies scattered across the
        chamber were under attack by a pack of armed gnolls under
        the direction of a shadar-kai.
        The east and west walls of the chamber were lined with
        dark arrow slits. Two trapdoors in the southern part of the
        chamber were open, ladders visible and leading down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Faced with a large force, our heroes enacted a fighting retreat back down 
        the hall and out through the portals, using Melvin's mastery of the portals 
        to divert their enemies and release them in managable chunks. Despite the 
        advantage the shadar-kai and a gnoll warmaster with an especially 
        powerful sword made it a close battle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Searching the shadar-kai's possessions, our heroes discovered a note:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Kyrion,
        </p>
        <p>
            Let me make my orders clear: you are there only to
            train the gnolls, not to fight for them. Watch yourself;
            they are a bloodthirsty and violent lot, and they
            may turn on you. You may need to remind them
            from time to time that I pay them well for their services,
            and that I can withdraw my support for their
            butchery at any time. Be careful of their leader, for
            he is far more cunning than others would give him
            credit for. I would not have even considered trying to
            trick them into service with that "Emissary" deception
            that riled up that fool Sinruth. These gnolls
            have the power of their foul god on their side. They
            are not to be trifled with.
        </p>
        <p>
            — Sarshan
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The gnoll warmaster carried the sword known as Wicked Fang.
        <span class="future">It was crafted as a gift
        for the gnoll pack of the same name. Sarshan ordered
        his shadar-kai warriors to travel to Overlook and
        kidnap one of the greatest dwarven weaponsmiths in
        the city, bringing him back to the Shadowfell to do
        the arms dealer's bidding. Sarshan commanded the
        weaponsmith to craft Wicked Fang. When the job was
        done, Sarshan ordered the weaponsmith killed and
        his blood used in the ritual that bestowed the sword
        with its magical properties.
        Sarshan sent his lieutenant Kyrion back to the world 
        to train the gnolls in the proper use of shadar-kai weapons.
        The completed sword was given as a gift to Fangren, who in 
        turn gave it to his most trusted warmaster.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Exhausted, our heroes rested the night while Melvin 
        concentrated on holding the portals. They awoke unharmed 
        but Melvin had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p class="future">
        Mentally attuned to the psychic energies of Fortress Graystone, 
        Melvin "heard" a mental plea for help and followed it through the 
        portals and the waterfall room into a meditation chamber the gnolls 
        had jammed shut with the broken haft of a spear. Scrawled across its face
        are warnings written in the Abyssal tongue of the gnolls:
        "DANGER! HAUNTED! STAY OUT!" 
    </p>
    <p class="future">
        The meditation chamber did house the cast-off malignant psychic residue 
        of past petitioners that attacked Melvin, but his training allowed him 
        to overcome them. Once on the meditation platform Melvin established a psychic 
        link to the "voice" - surprisingly his missing master Marduk Goldbludgeon. 
        Melvin's master told him he was holed up with his own githzerai masters - who 
        were pursued by a relentless horde of githyanki. Using the psychic energies of 
        the fortress Marduk attempted to teleport Melvin to him using the githzerai 
        psychic network connecting their fortresses across the Elemental Chaos.
        However, something severed the network mid-transport and Melvin was lost 
        in the vastness of the Elemental Chaos.

    <p>
        The rest of the part went in search of Melvin in the only place they had yet to look: 
        Fangren's ritual chamber at the back of the complex. 
        A deep thrumming noise echoed throughout this high-domed
        ritual chamber, the air crackling with energy.
        Three large cauldrons burned furiously along walls that rose
        10 feet to a wide balcony fronted by crimson curtains. An
        altar sat atop a stepped dais in the center of the room, a
        group of hooded gnolls around it and a supine form atop it <span class="future">Bin</span>. 
        A short distance away,
        the air rippled in a shifting haze of energy where a portal
        took form.

    <p>
        Several gnolls mounted on giant slaughterfang hyenas and a pair of crocottas patrolled the circumference.
        Scattered around the chamber were a number of
        hunched humanoid creatures - the helpless captives of
        Elsir Vale, transformed into horrid abyssal wretches. As
        they spotted our heroes, they raised a keening howl, lurching forward
        to attack.
    </p>
    <p>
        A brutal battle followed in which our heroes defeated Fangren's minions and then faced off with 
        the chieftain himself, directing the planar energy of the rift like a weapon - the giant claw of 
        Yeenoghu lashing out at them from the Elemental Chaos. With Fangren defeated our heroes rescued the 
        unconscious female doppelganger <span class="future">Bin</span> from the altar and worked to redirect 
        the planar energies in a new ritual described by Amyria.
    </p>
    <p>
        A vortex of brilliant energy opened up in the air as the
        platinum sword was gently tugged from Festivus' hands. It rose
        to hover in the air before the newly formed conduit, tendrils
        of silver light reaching out to touch it. All were blinded by
        a brilliant flash, then an instant later, the ritual chamber
        fell silent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Standing there was a young human female of
        unearthly beauty and grace. Her silver hair hung down her
        back, a band of chalk-white pigment stretching from one
        temple to the other across her eyes. She was garbed in armor
        made of slender, overlapping plates. In one hand, she held
        a leather-bound tome; in the other, the platinum longsword.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "I am Amyria. Who are you, and why am I here?...
        I remember that I am Amyria, and I
        have lived many lives. I was in the sword. I remember you
        freed me. The ritual you performed transformed the planar
        breach in this place, allowing it to channel the energy of the
        Astral Sea. Energy necessary for my transformation.
        I have been reborn with purpose,
        even if that purpose is yet unclear to me."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Much to her own
        consternation, Amyria was not fully certain why she had
        been brought there. She did not recognize our heroes
        or their names, and had no memory of her words to
        them while her spirit lingered within the sword.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond her minimal recollections, Amyria was a clean
        slate - her transformation a literal rebirth. Though
        she was of an adult mindset, she knew nothing of her
        own past.
    </p>
    <p>
        The leather-bound tome is a ritual book that
        Amyria gave to Festivus with her thanks. It contained
        a modified version of the ritual just performed, allowing
        her to stop the flow of energy that fuels a
        planar portal and safely seal away the danger of Fortress Graystone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Searching Fangren's body, our heroes discovered a note:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            I cannot stress the importance of holding Fortress
            Graystone. Among the assignments I have given you, this
            should be your top priority. I have armed you well enough
            that you should be able to repel all invaders.
            Do what you will with your prisoners, but continue
            taking them. Focus your efforts on those who seem to be
            of some importance; do not waste your time with farmers
            and commoners.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am sending someone to train your recruits in the use of
            our weapons, at your request. However, I expect you to leave
            this one alone. The witch I sent to you was one of my personal
            advisors, and now she is ruined. Do not treat my people so
            callously as you do your own.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Bin awoke a short while later. In her unconscious state her true 
        identity was apparent, though immediately upon waking she adopted 
        the disguise of another race using her natural abilities. She admitted 
        to having no memory of her past save the last several months. She awoke 
        with no memory in Nine Bells in Overlook. There she was revived, named 
        ("bin" means "empty cup" in Dwarven), and given purpose by the local priestess Aelys, 
        putting her powers of disguise to work infiltrating  the evil forces working 
        against Elsir Vale. While infiltrating the Wicked Fang tribe she was captured 
        and subjected to Fangren's corrupt rituals manipulating enemies from the 
        Elemental Chaos. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the battle our heroes were weakened and injured - the perfect time 
        for a suckerpunch. Coming upon our weary heroes Gilgathorn revealed his true nature 
        as a bounty hunter intent on collecting Sarshan's price on their heads. He attacked 
        with his minions and figurines of wondrous power (an Ironwood Hound and an Elderwood Falcon), 
        but despite their battle wounds (and with Bin's assistance), our heroes proved victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
        As they exited the fortress,
        Amyria requested that they accompany her to Overlook,
        not back to Brindol, as she believed she has
        business there. With the Wicked Fang dead Bin's mission 
        was complete, and she joined our heroes for the trek 
        back to Overlook.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once back in Overlook Amyria bids our heroes farewell once they reached the
        entrance to the city, slipping away into the crowd.
        Karrion and Kitara surreptiously tailed her to the Temple of Ioun in the Nine Bells district.
        There, she immediately became lost in prayer, lingering apparently indefinitely. The party took 
        shifts watching the deva, but eventually lost track of her in their subsequent adventures.
