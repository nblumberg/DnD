    <h2>Rescue at Rivenroar</h2>

        After the race, our heroes are celebrating in the Antler and Thistle tavern, flirting with their waitress Alys, when the gentle hubbub of the evening was shattered by the crack of the front door flying off its hinges
        to land amid the nearest tables. Four hobgoblins rushed into the bar, swords outstretched to skewer the nearest bar patrons.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "For Sinruth! For the Hand!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        they cried.
    </p>
    <p>A fight ensued and our heroes quickly dispatched the intruders, but the scuffle left several patrons dead and the tavern aflame.</p>

    <p>
        Our heroes organized a bucket brigade to douse the flames, only to be interrupted by shouts in the distance. As they approach the shouts resolve into a throng of townsfolk running around the street corner to the north, fleeing a curious sight: a full-grown ogre pulling a wagon by a yoke around its waist. The ogre held a cask in one hand and a massive club in the other. Riding atop the wagon were two hobgoblins with bows. The ogre tossed casks of flaming pitch into other buildings in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>After a harrowing battle with the ogre where our heroes turned the explosive casks against the ogre a crowd gathered and more guards arrived a few minutes later. They immediately ask for the party's help defending the bridge, but by the time they reach the bridge, the invading band had already retreated.</p>
    <p>The residents of Brindol spent the rest of the night putting out the fires that the goblins set, tended to the wounded, and kept a nervous watch from the ramparts.</p>

    <p>
        The next morning, the full extent of the attack was known: the invaders looted the Hall of Great Valor and kidnapped several citizens, dragging them off into the hills. Among the kidnappees were:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jalissa, a pretty acolyte of Ioun and alchemist, but a woman without the spine for such trauma, making her hysterical.</li>
        <li>Sertanian, the castellan of the Hall of Great Valor and a former soldier during the Red Hand invasion. Then well into his eighties he was hard, weathering the event with dignity.</li>
        <li>Thurann, the 8-year-old of Kartenix the guard captain, was brave and observant, handling the event better than many of the adults and stealing food for Jalissa.</li>
        <li>Mirtala, a middle-aged cook with claustrophobia, went nearly catatonic while held in a crypt with dire rats.</li>
        <li>Zerriska, an herbalist and self-described "witch" in her seventies, managed to bluff her captors into giving her a wide berth.</li>
        <li>Adronsius, a dwarven alchemist with an attitude, he suffered severe, repeated beatings at the hands of his captors thanks to the racial enmity between dwarves.</li>
        <li>Kartenix, the captain of the Brindol city guard and father of Thuran, fought his captors and met an early death at the hands of the goblins' pet ettercaps.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Among the stolen treasures were:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ornate, gilded dragoncrest helm</li>
        <li>Ceremonial platinum longsword; too heavy and blunt to be useful as a weapon <span class="future">this is the sword from which Amyria later sprang</span></li>
        <li>Set of three shields with the Red Hand insignia, each with a charred hole near the center</li>
        <li>Set of iron gauntlets with extensive filigree</li>
        <li>Heraldic battle standard depicting two hands clasped in a handshake</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        However, the city guard had managed to capture one of the invaders alive: a hobgoblin named Morrik held in the city stocks, bruised, covered in rotten tomatoes but bandaged and alive.
    </p>
    <p>
        With their local fame from the race and their proven valor against the invaders, the Brindol town council requested our heroes' assistance in rescuing its kidnapped citizens and recovering the stolen treasures.
        After forcefully questioning Morrik our heroes learn that the leader of the goblins was a hobgoblin named Sinruth and he eventually wanted to raise an army and carve out a fiefdom of his own.
        The goblins were using catacombs under the ruins of Castle Rivenroar as a base for now. Morrik and the other hobgoblins were ordered to take prisoners during the raid to give to the "undead horrors" that guard part of the goblins' lair.
        Morrik draws a crude map of the mountain path that leads to Castle Rivenroar.
        From her knowledge of history, Festivus surmises that Sinruth and the goblins see themselves as descendants of the Red Hand horde that menaced Brindol years ago, but it was also apparent to a student of history that they have no actual connection with the historic Red Hand.
        They were flying the Red Hand insignia upside-down, for starters.

    <p>
        Following Morrik's map with Lechonero tracking the goblins, our heroes arrived at the ruins of Rivenroar Castle, a former tiefling stronghold from the ancient kindgom of Rhestilor.
        Almost nothing remained above ground of the fortress, but our heroes descended into the open catacombs, facing goblins, gnome skulks, dire rats, ettercaps, and ancient traps.
        Among the magical curiosities in the catacombs was a dim "picture" in the middle of a room showing flickering images of a sinister tower in the middle of a shadowy swamp
        <span class="future">what our heroes would later discover to be a one-way portal to Umbraforge</span>.
        Our heroes liberated Thurann, Mirtala, Zerriska, and Adronsius, but were too late to save Kartenix.
    </p>

    <p>
        Passing down to the lower levels, our heroes liberated Sertanian and Jalissa - who instantly attached herself to Richard D'Eversholt - and eventually confronted Sinruth himself.
        After dispatching the hobgoblin, our heroes recovered the looted treasures from the Hall of Great Valor in a nearby crypt and a lightning whip and a suspicious note from Sinruth's person
        indicating a patron <span class="future">later discovered to be Modra acting on Sarshan's behalf</span>:
    </p>
    <img src="BASE/npcs/Sinruth.png" class="left" />
    <blockquote>
        <p>Brave Sinruth,</p>
        <p>The Red Hand will rise again! The other remnants take great cheer in your recent attacks on commerce coming into The Blight That is Brindol.</p>
        <p>We're particularly pleased with your ability to inspire a fighting spirit in others, whether they have true goblin blood or merely wish they did. To be blunt, we think you should have many more soldiers under your command. Many, many more.</p>
        <p>And recent events have rendered some remnants leaderless. With a bold stroke on your part, the remnants would rally to the Red Hand you so proudly display.</p>
        <p>
            As your bold stroke, do this: Attack the The Blight That is Brindol by night. Focus your efforts on their Hall of
            Great Valor, for it mocks the many hard-won victories by the first Red Hand of Doom. Take from them the spoils
            of war they shamelessly hang on their walls and bring those antiques back to Rivenroar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do this before the moon is next full. And with regard to your previous question, turning over captives to your
            unliving allies at Rivenroar is perfectly acceptable. War sometimes makes strange bedfellows, and we appreciate
            how you've united such disparate forces under your banner. Whatever prisoners you take from Rivenroar you can
            give to the wight.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fight with the valor of your ancestors, Sinruth. And keep your hands stained red with the blood of the weak!
            I will visit you again next month, at a time of my choosing.
        </p>
        <p>The Emissary</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        After our heroes returned the surviving hostages and the recovered treasures to Brindol, Richard D'Eversholt retired from the party to settle down with Jalissa and assist Sertanian
        running the Hall of Great Valor and establishing a proper temple to his god Bahamut in the town. The rest of the party continued on to the city of Overlook in the west to join the
        battle against the invading orc hordes.
