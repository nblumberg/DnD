    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        50 years have passed since a small band of heroes known as the Dawn Wardens 
        broke the grasping claws of the Red Hand and saved the civilized settlements of the 
        Elsir Vale from conquest and ruin. Peace has reigned for a generation and the cities 
        of the vale have once again grown prosperous on renewed trade routes following the Dawn Way. 
        Growth has been steady, but some of the scars of the past have yet to fade.

        Now war comes again to the idyllic vale, but the heroes of old have passed into memory and legend; 
        yet their legacy remains to answer the call to arms: Our new heroes are all the children, relatives, or students of 
        members of the Dawn Wardens. Having inherited the skill and wanderlust that afflicted their 
        forebears, they leave their homes in defense of the vale against the orcish hordes rumored to be approaching from the 
        savage plains beyond the western mountains. Though many of the simple folk spread throughout the vale dismiss the idea 
        of war raging anew, you know better, and interruptions in the trade along the Dawn Way have 
        caused the less stoic to begin voicing concern.

        Seeking coin to pay for arms and armor on their way to the front, our heroes join the company of worried merchant caravans 
        headed west along the Dawn Way to Brindol, acting as guards. Passing 
        occasional farms and hamlets the caravan guard slowly grows, gradually accruing new recruits, many of whom they've met through 
        the fraternity of their formerly adventuring relatives or masters. In the days spent following the sun, former acquaintances 
        have coalesced into a group of fast friends, trading posts with others until you all travel together with the same caravan in 
        the employ of Axenhaft Security.

        Talk passes along the road from traveler to traveler and news of an upcoming midsummer festival in Brindol 
        dominates the gossip. Supposedly the festival marks the anniversary of the Dawn Warden's defeat of the 
        Red Hand. Many say that the highlight of the annual festival is an urban footrace commemorating the grueling 
        marathon run by the heroes of that war to warn the people of Brindol of the impending attack. Entry is open 
        to all, the race draws a heavy crowd, and rumor has it the winner draws a heavy purse and possibly a prize of magic. Some hopeful 
        travelers boast of their intent to enter and win, despite worries of some underhanded tactics used by competitors in the past.  
        The excitement is catching and as a team our heroes plan to enter the race and divide the winnings among themselves.

        Just as they shake on the arrangement the caravan turns a bend in the road around a lazy hillock and the jovial camaraderie is broken 
        by the sound of screams and drawn steel. After a short and brutal skirmish with a large group of well-armed goblins 
        <span class="future">Tusk's scouts armed by Modra with Sarshan's weapons</span>, 
        the merchants in the caravan lay dead, leaving our heroes unemployed but with a wagon full of goods to finance the race entry.
