        Brindol was in the middle of celebrating the anniversary of the victory over the Red Hand of Doom.
        The pinnacle of the celebration is the cross city race and the town is alive with talk about it.
        The race is held every year on the same day.
        The goal is to take a letter from the southern gate to the northern watchtower as quickly as possible.
        While the race started out as a competition between two message carriers and a celebration of the city's history, it is now open to anyone.
        There are loose rules about the use of magic and physical violence between competitors but it is, for the most part, a free-for-all with almost anything being considered "fair".
        The race is also open to interference from the citizens.
        Many bands of children, ruffians, and the bored delight in setting "traps" for the racers and watching them take a tumble.
        The prize for this punishing race is coin and the added inducement of a magical item from the treasury.

        The favored competitors were:
        <ul>
            <li>Dorion Light-Step, an elven ranger from the nearby woodlands, venturing out in the world and seeking to make a name for himself</li>
            <li>Garth Cooper, a member of the local watch, young and arrogant and looking to win in order to bump himself up the ranks and to impress a girl he likes very much</li>
            <li>Two-Teeth, a brute named after the teeth he lost after being kicked by a wild horse, is a half-orc barbarian who is traveling through Brindol on his way to somewhere else.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The rules were simple:
        <ul>
            <li>Participants in the race must be present two hours after first light at the southern gate.</li>
            <li>Participants must not begin running until the gate portcullis hits the ground.</li>
            <li>Participants may not directly attack another runner with magic or arms. Roughhousing, wrestling, and bare-hands brawling are permitted.</li>
            <li>Participants must travel on foot (or their species equivalent). Mounts, magical travel, flying more than a few feet at a time, and any other forms of movement that the judges
                deem to be cheating will get the racer disqualified.</li>
            <li>The first one to hand their letter to the town elder at the top of the northern watchtower is the winner and will be awarded the prize. The elder's decision is final in the event of
                an apparent tie.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The crowds cheered as the contestants lined up just inside the southern gate, sizing each other up.
        With a great deal of gravitas, Kartenix, the captain of the watch passes before each contestant, bows, and presents them with a small scroll bound up with red ribbon -
        the message to be delivered at the end of the race.
        With this accomplished, he paces to the side of the starting line and raises a bright red handkerchief and waves it furiously like a flag to signal the guards.
        After a moment there is a loud "CLANG!" right behind the runners as the portcullis drops. The race had begun!
    </p>
    <p>The race ran across the rooves and streets of the magical, poor and wealthy quarters, through ship rigging and across barges on the river, and past crowds in the market and cart pileups on the bridge.</p>
    <p>
        To win the race, one needs to clamber to the top of the northern watchtower and hand their letter to the town elder.
        The tower is old and craggy and many of the bricks look loose.
        Pigeons roost amongst the nooks and crannies and the stone is stained white with their droppings in many places, incongruous clumps of wild grasses and flowers sprouting from unlikely places amongst the brickwork.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a tight race, Melvin was first to press the crumpled and illegible note into the town elder's hand and who raised his arm triumphantly, proclaiming him to be the winner and ringing the alarum bell that hangs in the tower.
        As it peeled, a great cheer went up from the crowd and the town crier solemnly stepped forward to present Melvin's prize, a fine pair of boots that twinkled with the glow of magic and a small but weighty coffer of gold.
