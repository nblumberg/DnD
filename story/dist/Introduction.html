    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        50 years had passed since a small band of heroes known as the Dawn Wardens
        broke the grasping claws of the Red Hand and saved the civilized settlements of the
        Elsir Vale from conquest and ruin. Peace had reigned for a generation and the cities
        of the vale had once again grown prosperous on renewed trade routes following the Dawn Way.
        Growth had been steady, but some of the scars of the past had yet to fade.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then war came again to the idyllic vale, but the heroes of old had passed into memory and legend;
        yet their legacy remained to answer the call to arms: Our new heroes were all the children, relatives, or students of
        members of the Dawn Wardens. Having inherited the skill and wanderlust that afflicted their
        forebears, they left their homes in defense of the vale against the orcish hordes rumored to be approaching from the
        savage plains beyond the western mountains. Though many of the simple folk spread throughout the vale dismissed the idea
        of war raging anew, our heroes knew better, and interruptions in the trade along the Dawn Way had
        caused the less stoic to begin voicing concern.

        Seeking coin to pay for arms and armor on their way to the front, our heroes joined the company of worried merchant caravans
        headed west along the Dawn Way to Brindol, acting as guards. Passing
        occasional farms and hamlets the caravan guard slowly grew, gradually accruing new recruits, many of whom they'd met through
        the fraternity of their formerly adventuring relatives or masters. In the days spent following the sun, former acquaintances
        had coalesced into a group of fast friends, trading pasts with others until they all travelled together with the same caravan in
        the employ of Axenhaft Security.
    </p>
    <p>
        Talk passed along the road from traveler to traveler and news of an upcoming midsummer festival in Brindol
        dominated the gossip. Supposedly the festival marked the anniversary of the Dawn Warden's defeat of the
        Red Hand. Many said that the highlight of the annual festival was an urban footrace commemorating the grueling
        marathon run by the heroes of that war to warn the people of Brindol of the impending attack. Entry was open
        to all, the race drew a heavy crowd, and rumor had it the winner drew a heavy purse and possibly a prize of magic. Some hopeful
        travelers boasted of their intent to enter and win, despite worries of some underhanded tactics used by competitors in the past.
        The excitement was catching and as a team our heroes planned to enter the race and divide the winnings among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as they shook on the arrangement the caravan turned a bend in the road around a lazy hillock and the jovial camaraderie was broken
        by the sound of screams and drawn steel. After a short and brutal skirmish with a large group of well-armed goblins
        <span class="future">Tusk's scouts armed by Modra with Sarshan's weapons</span>,
        the merchants in the caravan lay dead, leaving our heroes unemployed but with a wagon full of goods to finance the race entry.
