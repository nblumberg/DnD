            Son of the late satyr demigod Papposilenus and a druid upholding his father's ideals, Barases searches for his brother Petraynus - heir to his father's godhead.
            His father's domain has grown increasingly strained and twisted after his passing, rot settling into the heart of the wood. Dutiful and loyal, Barases has ventured
            far from the comfort of the Feywild in search of the prodigal son in hopes of restoring balance.

            the evil forces working against Elsir Vale. While infiltrating the Wicked Fang tribe she was captured and subjected to
            Fangren's corrupt rituals manipulating enemies from the Elemental Chaos. Rescued before being sacrificed, Bin now continues

            propriety of her Dragonborn culture - even her gender (she is physically male). Blessed (or cursed) with her father's wanderlust
            she left home to train as a bard where her flamboyant rebellion, cross-dressing fashion sense, and acerbic wit found an
            appreciative audience. She has a talent for appealing to the rebels in restrictive cultures and has plied it with success among
            the dwarves of Elsir Vale. She searches for a way to truly break free of her bonds and fully realize her feminine self.

            the general aloofness of the elves made her father distant, and in reaction to that pain she rejected the calming influence of her father's nature and
            gave into the evil pull of her infernal heritage - resorting to alcohol, drugs, and eventually crime. Her vices have spiraled on multiple occasions,

            Drafted into the Fomori legion, she was raised to be an elite warrior and an arcane assassin. At puberty she was taken by the coven of Howling Hags in service
            to Cachlain and multilated in perverse Fomori rituals - they took her eye and part of her soul but grafted a new eye and part of new soul in its place. The
            ritual twisted her, but also granted her greater powers. Feeling betrayed by this violation Kitara fled Cachlain's service and ended up working as a mercenary
            under Sarshan before leaving his service as well in disgust. Now she acts against her former masters in a mission of revenge.

            help guard the borders against the orc hordes to the south. When Thrand travelled to Elsir Vale as a member of the Dawn Wardens Lechonero made
            frequent visits to his mentor. Taking advantage of his frequent trips along the Dawn Way, Lechonero's clan elder Caliandra used him as a trading
            envoy to the eastern city of Dornaithos, the first trading post of Astrazalian fully in the world. When Thrand returned to the Stagrunners he
            charged Lechonero with looking after his daughters Kallista and Karrion. Recently in Dornaithos, Lechonero had an affair with
            Brandowen ("Brandi") Entromiel - the master of that mercantile settlement and as aggressive a lover as she was a saleswoman. In a heated moment
            that ended their affair Lechonero inadvertently absconded with her bonded bear companion from the Feywild and he has been avoiding her ever since.

            Azarr Kul was a half-dragon hobgoblin warrior and a child of the blue dragon Tyrgarun.
            Azarr Kul discovered the Thane of Tiamat (an abandonned temple deep in the Wyrmsmoke Mountains) and converted from worshipping
            Maglubiyet to Tiamat. He united the goblinoid tribes of the Wyrmsmoke Mountains and dubbed them the Kulkor Zhul and adopted the
            standard of the Red Hand (an ancient symbol of Tiamat's cult). Conquering the Wyrmsmoke Mountains he named his kingdom Harg
            Kulkor - "Land of the Dragon." Crowning himself High Wyrmlord he marched his army to conquer an unsuspecting Elsir Vale. The
            adventuring party the Dawn Wardens encountered the army early by happenstance and stymied its advance by collapsing the ancient
            dwarven bridge at Skull Gorge. In the interim they rallied the people of the vale to defend against the Red Hand and ultimately
            assassinated Azarr Kul. Without his leadership his fractuous army split and turned on itself, leading to its defeat by the
            peoples of the Vale.

            Caliandra of the Stagrunners was an ancient elf
            who could trace her descendants back to elves who migrated
            from the Feywild almost eleven of her generations
            ago. She lead not only her own tribe, the Stagrunners (of which Lechonero is a part),
            but had also been named the voice of all the
            tribes that live in the wild reaches to the north and
            west of Elsir Vale. All told, she spoke for a group of
            twenty-five tribes.
            Fierce, wild, and haughty, she was stubborn and
            opinionated, and wasn't afraid to engage in a protracted
            argument about aspects of history that most
            people had long forgotten. She held influence
            with many gnome, elf, and eladrin leaders, much
            as a respected grandmother and advisor might.
            She leaned toward solutions that provided the
            most safety for the most people. She seemed to expect
            subservience, making her nearly intolerable
            to deal with.
            One of the naysayers of the Gatekeepers, Caliandra
            automatically assumed her age and experience made
            her the voice everyone else should listen to. She talked
            loudly, fiercely, and often, but she didn't mince
            words. She got to her point quickly. She favored action
            of some sort, but was like a ship in need of a pilot. If
            given a course that she could approve of - something
            that will let her lead her people to glorious battle
            against the invaders who have killed so many of her
            people - she would fight honorably and without hesitation.
            But she demanded respect, and was fond of rejecting
            someone else's idea out of hand, only to bring it back
            up minutes later as a concept all her own.

            foremost, was to see that his city came out ahead in
            the war. He wasn't willing to side with the githyanki
            invaders, but his goal was to lead the alliance so that
            his small city was given due representation. He knew
            that Sayre's leadership wouldn't have been consulted
            if not for the good fortune of hosting the first meeting
            and the absence of a representative from Nefelus.

            Fangren was a demonic gnoll and chief of the Wicked Fang tribe who plagued the lands around
            the Giantshield Mountains. Receiving aid (in the form of weapons and advisors) from Sarshan,
            Fangren took up residence in the abandoned monastery, Fortress Graystone.
            He attempted to use the planar energies of the Elemental Chaos woven into the place by its
            githzerai creators to perform a ritual that would turn him into an exarc of the demon lord
            Yeenoghu. Our heroes killed Fangren's followers and shadar-kai allies before halting the
            Fangren's ritual sacrifice of Bin and instead channeled the ritual's energies into a ritual
            of their own that released Amyria from her sword. Melvin mysteriously disappeared while exploring
            Fortress Graystone, only to reappear months later fighting the githyanki. Among Sarshan's gifts
            to Fangren was the magical blade called Wicked Fang in honor of his tribe.

            Fariex the Scalehammer was a tall, richly dressed man with a burnished dark complexion.
            He was a powerful merchant with interests
            in various cities. Fariex did not represent a city
            or other political body, but was invited to the Gatekeepers because of his
            connections to many far-reaching settlements, townships,
            and ports, and the wealth and military might
            they represent.
            He was light-hearted by nature, and knew more jokes
            than most jesters. Far from a buffoon, however,
            he expected respect.
            He was slow to weigh the facts of a problem instead of quickly
            making up his mind.
            Generally quiet, Fariex would occasionally interject a pointed question,
            especially if the topic of conversation touched on his
            area of expertise (namely, money and its movement
            through business affairs). He openly tried to
            catch others in duplicity or engage in some word play
            over a statement he perceived as absurd.

            worn down by these encounters and his own traps before attacking, pretending to help them
            against other enemies if it looked like someone else might successfully collect the bounty.

            Inogo Dravitch was a dragonborn priest of Erathis. Inogo hailed
            from the distant city of Sherrbyr (Festivus' home). This city lies far
            to the northeast, beyond Elsir Vale by at least three
            weeks' travel. Inogo was the current leader of this city of
            temples. A theocratic city state, Sherrbyr also boasted
            a massive college of divinity, where worshipers of
            nearly any deity could openly practice their faith.
            As a result of its varied populace, the city's leadership
            was formed of a council of priests of the most
            worshiped deities in the city. The council changed as
            the population changed. Some deities fell out of favor
            while others rose. But Erathis's worshipers had been
            a power in the city for years, and Inogo was the most
            recent in a long series of Erathis-worshiping council
            leaders known as Deacons.
            Sherrbyr was a city accustomed to nearly endless
            debate, thanks to efforts to accommodate every faith
            represented on the ruling council. As someone long
            schooled in this approach to government, Deacon
            Dravitch was well out of his league in a group that needs
            to make decisions quickly and decisively. He represented
            a powerful city, however, in terms of both its
            military and divine might. Sherrbyr could field a veritable
            army of healers, as well as a mounted corps of
            paladins. Inogo was mostly quiet in the meetings,
            speaking up only when a plan of action is proposed.

        <span class="description">
            Sinruth was a hobgoblin with greater aspirations than
            a life spent preying on the fringes of civilization. He
            listened closely at the campfires when his fathers
            and uncles told tales of the Red Hand of Doom, a
            mighty army that ran across the land like a scythe.
            And when he became an adult and a leader of his
            own band of hobgoblins, he found a cache of tunics
            and weapons left behind by that army. Sinruth felt
            his destiny calling. He declared himself the new
            Warlord of Sinruth's Hand (as he named the group),
            emblazoned every possible surface with a crudely
            painted, downward thrusting red hand insignia, and
            set about recruiting the massive army that he felt was
            his birthright.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But starting an army wasn't as easy as those campfire
            tales led Sinruth to believe. Years passed with
            Sinruth's band eking out a meager existence in the
            wilderness. But slowly, he started to gain allies. A
            temporary bargain with some sinister, mischievous
            gnomes blossomed into a lasting friendship. The Red
            Hand's exploration of the mountains unearthed some
            undisturbed catacombs beneath the long-ruined
            Castle Rivenroar. Sinruth struck another bargain,
            and the undead guardians let the Red Hand move
            in, in exchange for periodic payment of kidnapped
            prisoners.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sinruth and the reconstituted Red Hand had a
            base and a growing reputation, but they were far from
            a mighty army. An "Emissary" from another remnant of
            the Red Hand offered to join forces under Sinruth's
            banner and more than double Sinruth's fifty soldiers
            under arms. All Sinruth had to do was attack Brindol,
            steal some relics from the original Red Hand invasion,
            and take enough prisoners to keep the undead
            guardians of Rivenroar satisfied.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sinruth personally led the assault on Brindol, sacking
            Brindol's Hall of Great Valor, stealing back
            many of the museum pieces on display there. Sinruth
            brought back seven prisoners, despite the fact that the
            new Red Hand lost half its number in the attack.

            Sinruth died at the hands of the Dusk Wardens when they
            came to rescue the prisoners and retrieve the relics.

        <span class="description">
            Tusk was an orc leader is an overlarge warrior and chieftain. Not a true orc, he has the blood of
            ogres in his veins, which made him larger, tougher,
            and eminently more dangerous. Having slaughtered
            half a dozen orc chieftains, he drew together the
            unruly tribes to mount an offensive against Bordrin's
            Watch to lay claim to the soft lands beyond its walls.
            Tusk knew the history of the Stonehome Mountains
            well, knowing that unless he could find some way to
            bypass the fortress in the mountains, it wouldn't matter
            how many warriors he commanded since he would fail.
            What Tusk needed was a way around the fortress.
            Ever resourceful and with numerous contacts and
            allies, Tusk turned to his occasional lover and advisor,
            a shadar-kai witch named Myrissa. He sent her back
            to the Shadowfell to recruit allies to help his cause,
            and a short time later she returned with a small army
            of dark ones, led by a mysterious and sinister dark
            creeper, known as the Emissary (Modra). This leader offered
            to assist Tusk in exchange for an exclusive arrangement
            in which they would supply Tusk's armies with
            weaponry for whatever price Modra asked, and in exchange, the dark creepers
            would find a way through the mountains. Tusk readily
            agreed and paid the exorbitant price, gaining a
            fine arsenal, and also, he hoped, the key to victory.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Not long after, the dark creepers returned and
            revealed a number of tunnels burrowed beneath the
            mountain. They showed the chieftain the locations of
            each, explaining how the passages connected one side
            of the mountains to the other. No tunnel was large
            enough to accommodate his entire army, so, Tusk
            gave his horde their marching orders, sending them
            to climb the mountain slopes, while his scouts moved
            ahead to secure the tunnels and prepare the way for
            Tusk and his elite warriors to strike the fortress from
            below.

            <p>
                Once, he reigned supreme.
            </p>
            <p>
                General Zithiruun was a great hero - one of the
                most respected military leaders of a militant race.
                From the great city of Tu'narath, he led armies of the
                githyanki on raids across the Astral Sea, and into a
                dozen different regions and kingdoms of the mortal
                realm. From the deck of the astral galleon Siun'kara
                or the back of Rathoraiax, his great red dragon steed,
                Zithiruun proved an unstoppable force - a champion
                among a race of champions. Even Vlaakith, the
                fearsome githyanki lich queen, acknowledged his
                greatness, heaped great praise upon him.
                And then the great General Zithiruun took on a
                foe beyond even his own prowess.
            </p>
            <p>
                That it was a dragon, a dragon far greater than
                Rathoraiax, everyone knows, but tales of the confrontation
                differ as to whether it was a black wyrm,
                one of the fearsome scourge dragons, or something
                else entirely. But while not everyone knows precisely
                what it was Zithiruun faced, everyone knows what
                happened as a result.
            </p>
            <p>
                A hideous burst of something - acid, perhaps, or
                pure necrotic energy - ripped the life from the red
                dragon Rathoraiax, shredding flesh and obliterating
                entire portions of the beast. And it was this attack
                that felled Zithiruun as well. It stripped the strength
                from his limbs, rotted bits of flesh and even weakened
                bone. Any lesser warrior would have died in that hideous
                moment, but the general clung to life through
                sheer force of stubborn, malignant will.
            </p>
            <p>
                It took years for Zithiruun to retrain and reinvigorate
                his broken body. Even by the time he encountered our heroes, he was a shadow of
                what he once was - weaker in body, far less sound in
                mind. His own people had all but turned their backs
                on him; though his great achievements prevented them
                from executing or exiling him utterly, they scorn his
                weakness and hold him in contempt for allowing himself
                and his mount to be so soundly defeated. By the siege of Overlook,
                Zithiruun served as a lowly operative of Tu'narath's
                forces and he led only lesser warriors into battle
                while answering to and obeying githyanki who would
                once have feared even to speak in his presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zithiruun's native powers had mutated through
                his years of effort as he attempted to reinvigorate
                his body at the expense of his mental prowess. The
                ambition all githyanki share had been subsumed by
                a burning need to prove himself and to regain the
                position and the respect that were once his by right -
                even as he nursed a resentful hatred of the very people
                whose adulation he so desperately craved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zithiruun had been large for a githyanki, but since the
                destruction and atrophy of much of his musculature,
                he appeared almost impossibly tall and gaunt.
                Mixed with and attached to the traditional leathers of
                his people, he wore a contraption of braces and harnesses,
                constructed of leather straps and iron joints.
            </p>
            <p>
                These braces, supported at his shoulders and by a strap
                across his chest, ran the length of his left arm and left
                leg, as well as a portion of his right leg. It is the straps
                that gave those limbs rigidity; without them, they could
                scarcely move, and not support his weight. This harness
                also granted him full mobility; charged with both
                magic and psychic energy, it permited him motion and
                granted him strength he would otherwise lack.
            </p>
            <p>
                His flesh clung tightly to his skeleton and puckered
                away from old wounds, exposing muscle and even
                charred bone. His left cheek gaped open, revealing
                a bit of metal plate that replaced a fragment of skull.
                A leather strap held the left side of his jaw in place,
                replacing obliterated muscle.
            </p>
            <p>
                He appeared weak indeed, and in some ways he
                truly was. Yet Zithiruun wielded his great silver saber
                with an astonishing, impossible precision, and his
                eyes burned with loathing and ambition to shame even
                the other githyanki.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite his drive, General Zithiruun met his end at the
                hands of our heroes when he laid siege to Overlook with
                his mercenary army.

            <h3>Overlook Summary</h3>
            <p>
                This city of stone stands on the side of the Stonehome Mountains. Constructed as a haven for newly liberated dwarves from their former giant masters, Overlook has since outgrown its noble roots and become a haven for peoples all over the Elsir Vale and beyond.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h5>Population:</h5>
                12,250; about another 5,000 people live in small settlements scattered on the lower slopes. The people of Overlook are mostly dwarves, humans, and halflings, though pockets of dragonborn, tiefling, eladrin, and elf communities are isolated in their own ethnic neighborhoods. Overlook's importance as a trade center results in great numbers of travelers from faraway lands and of a wild assortment of races, cultures, and beliefs, lending the city its cosmopolitan atmosphere. Government: The Council of Elders, a group of five male and female dwarves, governs Overlook. Each is elected to office and serves a 10-year term. The dwarves see ruling as a burden and none relish the job, preferring to hand power off to someone else. Heading up the Council is the Great Elder, Morgoff Stonefirst, an aging dwarf who's ready to retire.
            </div>
            <p>
                One representative from each of the eight districts of Overlook attends the Council, serving as advisors and also to air the grievances of their particular constituencies. Although these individuals have the power to influence, they have no real authority in the city, though many are wealthy and powerful by means other than the office they hold.
            </p>
            <div class="fullpage">
                <h5>Defense:</h5>
                Overlook keeps a standing garrison of 150 warriors armed and ready for any threat. In times of trouble (such as now), Overlook can muster another 500 warriors from the local militia, and another 100 from the outlying settlements. At Bordrin's Watch, another 500 hundred warriors protect the mountain pass from within its steep walls and skyscraping towers.

                The city of Overlook stands on the eastern slopes of
                the Stonehome Mountains, a hoary range of crumbling
                peaks as old as the world. The city's founding
                lies sometime far back in the mists of time, at a point
                after the dwarves in this region threw off the shackles
                of slavery and chased the giants and orcs west across
                the mountains at the end of the Age of Chains. Overlook,
                and the fastness of Bordrin's Watch, were raised
                to safeguard the liberated dwarf peoples and to be
                the first line of defense should their ancient enemies
                forget their defeat and seek to enslave the dwarves
                once more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since its founding, Overlook has never come under
                attack, though Bordrin's Watch has time and again,
                at least once every century. Overlook supplies the
                mountain pass with soldiers, supplies, and needed
                resources, ensuring the Watch is never without the
                goods they need to live up to their ancient responsibility.
                While doughty dwarf warriors hold the
                Watch, the city is far more cosmopolitan and includes
                peoples of nearly every race and culture known in
                this corner of the world. Dwarves are still the dominate
                group, but humans and halflings make up a
                close second, followed by dragonborn, tieflings, and a
                smattering of eladrin and elves, and an assortment of
                other, less familiar, races.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overlook is largely a trading center, and people
                on both sides of the mountain come to the city to
                exchange goods, rumors, and information. The city's
                numerous markets and bustling streets makes it the
                ideal place to do business, thus characters in search
                of a particular tool or device are more likely to find it
                here than anywhere for miles around.
            </p>
            <p>
                Supplementing its trade is a robust mining industry.
                The mountains are rich in iron, silver, tin, and no
                few gemstones. Dwarf and human miners and prospectors
                set out from Overlook each day, some working
                in the blackness of the deep mines, while others scour
                the heights in search of treasures-some succeeding,
                others failing, and others still vanishing in the misty
                peaks never to be seen again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the city depends on Bordrin's Watch to
                endure most of the attacks from the west, the city is
                not without its own defenses. The dwarves erected
                steep walls to protect themselves, but as the city outgrew
                its original protections, the inhabitants raised
                more walls to encircle the growing population. So far,
                this has happened four times, giving the city four sets
                of walls, one inside of the other. The shantytown, the
                unofficial ninth district, grows beyond the eastern
                walls and it's just a matter of time before the Council
                decides to raise another wall and add those squatters
                to the rest of the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                Piercing each wall, on both the western side and
                the eastern side, is a large gate flanked by two square
                stone towers. Most times, the gates stand open, even
                in the dead of night, but when trouble looms, such
                as now, the gates are closed at dusk, and the inner
                gates-the ones leading into High Hall - might close
                even earlier.

                The outer walls are 100 feet tall, taller where they travel over higher elevation.
                Each inner wall stands another 20 feet tall. Guards patrol the walls infrequently,
                though the gatehouses are held by a half-dozen warriors.

                <h3>Overlook Districts</h3>
                <p>Overlook has eight districts, each distinguished by the types of its people there as well as the industry one finds there.</p>
                <section id="Blister">
                    <h4>Blister</h4>
                    <blockquote>"Looking for work? You ought to prick the blister an' see what bubbles up . . ."</blockquote>
                    <p>The Blister is a rough-and-tumble section of the city, populated by mercenaries, adventurers, and the usual sort of traveling folk with few roots. Characterized by a great number of winesinks, taverns, pleasure dens, gambling halls, and bordellos, Blister is not a place to get lost.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                    Blister's buildings are a mix of timber and stone of architectural styles ranging the gamut. Old dwarven buildings stand next to almost organic tiefling dreaming halls, while a halfling gambling den sits in the shadow of an old temple dedicated to Sehanine in her more larcenous aspect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Streets:</h5>
                    Blister's roads thread their way through the press of buildings, darkened by shadows cast by structures built too close together. Filth and detritus clog the alleys, sometimes spilling out onto the major thoroughfares-that is, roads large enough to accommodate a horse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>People:</h5>
                    Humans, halflings, and dragonborn have the largest numbers in Blister, though one can find a variety of races here. As mentioned, most are adventurers, thieves, and traveling folk, representing the city's most diverse population.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Sights:</h5>
                    Visitors and inhabitants alike might see a pair of human thugs beating a half-orc with their clubs in an alley, a scantily clad man calling out to passersby, a street magician performing tricks, an elderly alchemist selling cure-alls, street preachers prophesizing the end of the world, tents and stalls, clotheslines stretched across the streets, and bands of adventurers looking for trouble.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Smells:</h5>
                    All sorts of odors waft up from Blister, including smells of exotic cuisine to the expected stench of a crowded district. Wood smoke hangs over the streets, mixing with other, more sinister smells.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Sounds:</h5>
                    Merchants hawk their wares amid laughter, screams, the murmur of crowds, the clatter of kitchens, cries of "thief!," the whistle of a constable in pursuit, the sounds of barking dogs, the hiss of cats, and the growls of spiretop drakes.

                    <h4>Boneyard</h4>
                    <blockquote>"Not much to do in the Boneyard aside from sicking up."</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Occupying the southeast corner of Overlook, Boneyard has every distasteful business and venture, including everything from the city's slaughterhouses, renderers, tanners, dyers, and even the city's graveyards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        As an industrial corner of the city, most buildings are plain and functional, and they are constructed to serve the operation and little else.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        The Boneyard features broad roads in good repair so wagons can easily navigate the district.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        Humans are the largest group of people here and most are dirty, lacking in sophistication, and inured to the foul odors wafting up from the more toxic parts of the district.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Sights:</h5>
                        Common sights include wagons laden with animal carcasses, workers trudging to their jobs, plumes of acrid smoke, and pipes leaking toxic fluids into the gutters. The Boneyard is as unpleasant to look at as it is to smell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Smells:</h5>
                        A pall of smoke stinking of urine and sulfur hangs over the Boneyard, turning the sun a pale shade of brown. Even though the locals do their best to keep the streets free of rubbish, the materials and industries produce ripe odors a shade better than death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Sounds:</h5>
                        One can hear the creaks of wagons, the spillage of liquids, crackling fire, the screams of animals at the slaughter, and the grunts of hard labor.

                    <h4>Elftown</h4>
                    <blockquote>"Don't know why they still call it Elftown; can't say as I've ever seen an elf there."</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elftown covers the northwestern corner of the inner city and takes its name from the one elf to live there some seventy years ago. The community consists of upscale and well-off entrepreneurs, merchants, bankers, lawyers, physicians, and other members of Overlook's upper crust, and many folk elsewhere want to inhabit a small house on the edge of this fine quarter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        With fine buildings of astonishing architecture, white-washed or painted in pastel colors, Elftown has some of the nicest homes and shops in the city. Even the smaller houses are sumptuous compared to those of pretty much anywhere else in the city, and all are accented by parks, lawns of green grass, statuary, and beds of exotic flowers and semimobile plants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        Aside from the broad Dwarfroad that winds though Elftown, most streets are large enough to accommodate two carriages side by side. The roads are covered in pale white stone and maintained by a legion of well-paid servants. Even the side streets are clean and lit with everburning torches contained in iron lanterns to chase away the shadows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        In spite of the name, few, if any, elves live in Elftown, though several eladrin are affiliated with the ambassador who takes residence here. Instead, wealthy humans and dwarves command this section of the city, though one can be sure to find a handful of dragonborn, a smattering of tieflings, and a few reckless halflings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Sights:</h5>
                        Observers can see black carriages pulled by teams of matching horses, patrols of uniformed guards, and fountains sending spray into the air, as well as servants painting houses, cleaning the streets, and avoiding attention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Smells:</h5>
                        One is likely to smell fine cooking, fresh-cut grass, the perfume of brilliant flowers, incense, and other pleasant aromas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Sounds:</h5>
                        Notes played on a harp, the singing of a lovely young woman (or a younger man), a haughty noble screaming at a servant, the whinny of horses, and the clink of gold are common sounds.

                    <p>
                        The Forgeworks, or just the Forge, is a middle-class district given over to successful artisans, tradesfolk, and other men and women who work hard and are successful in their professions. More than half of the buildings here are workshops with apartments overhead. Warehouses, businesses, stables, and other places of industry round out the rest. The Forgeworks stands in the Middle City, south of Tradetown.

                        Broad streets, wide enough to accommodate aurochs and wagons, run through this district, while narrow alleys branch off to disappear in the maze of buildings beyond. Cobbles cover the ground and most are even to provide smooth transport to and from the Forge.
                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        Dwarves and humans live side by side in the Forgeworks, but one can also find a small population of half-elves, gnomes, and a few others as well. During the day, business here brings folk from all over the city to do business.

                        The air is pregnant with the smells of sweat, smoke, and industry. Street vendors sell meat pies, sausages, and other portable foods for workers and visitors alike, lending the pleasant (or not so pleasant) aromas of their fare to the atmosphere. Although a busy part of Overlook, the Forgeworks is surprisingly clean.

                    <h4>High Hall</h4>
                    <blockquote>"The heart and soul of Overlook, son, High Hall is where the movers and shakers make all the decisions."</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        High Hall, or the Old City, is where the city leaders convene to govern Overlook. Few folk still live in High Hall since nearly every inch of available space is given over to the various ministries making up the city's government. Thus, aside from a few extremely wealthy folks, most people funnel out of High Hall at the end of the day to head home to Elftown, Stonehammer, or elsewhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        High Hall consists of a forest of massive buildings packed tightly inside its walls. Towers thrust up from the fortresslike structures, climbing high above the walls and affording a look at the entire city and the lands all around. Most buildings house one of the dozen or so ministries that see to keeping the city operating. Examples include the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of War, and so on. Each operates out of a marble or brick building fronted by impressive statues of dwarf warriors, artisans, and historical figures, while the walls themselves bear intricate carvings and bas-reliefs capturing key moments from the city's history. The outer edge of High Hall holds the businesses and few homes of those who grease the engines of politics. Restaurants, inns, and a few shops provide patronage to the city's elite, but they shut down at nightfall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        Suffering from too many buildings in a confined space, High Hall's roads are positively perilous. Tight and cramped while winding through the heart of Overlook, they contain numerous shadowy alcoves, dead-ends, and limited range of sight as they turn and twist. Although High Hall doesn't have a thievery problem, it does suffer from hired killers. The dwarves deal honorably with one another, but the same cannot be said for all the city's representatives, and rival humans, tieflings, and others might resort to murder to eliminate an inflexible politician. Thus, most high-ranking officials surround themselves with guards, making travel anywhere in High Hall all the harder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        The Council of Elders might all be dwarves, but the rest of the city's government is as diverse as the city. Bureaucrats, functionaries, messengers, and palanquins bearing representatives from other districts all make their way through High Hall throughout the day, and sometimes at night.
                    </p>

                        <h5>Sights:</h5>
                        Buildings, buildings, and more buildings crowd the district, their carved faades telling ancient stories of heroic dwarves, the end of the Age of Chains, and other historical events that helped shape this region. One might see workers cleaning up a murder scene, while street vendors sell everything from amulets that promise to bring good luck in the courts, to food dealers, and tattered street lawyers searching for clients.

                        Overcrowding and the malaise of too many people gives High Hall an unpleasant aroma in spite of the fact that the Council spares no expense in keeping this part of the city clean. Wafting up from the streets is a mix of rubbish, food, and sweat, but compared to other sections of Overlook, High Hall is tolerable.

                        Throughout the day, a steady hum of conversation sounds, punctuated with the ringing of bells, the angry shouts of guards as they escort their worthy charges through the press of people, voices raised in protest at some new law, and an assortment of other noises make High Hall loud. At night, however, it becomes deathly quiet.

                    <h4>Nine Bells</h4>
                    <blockquote>"Nine Bells, Nine Hells, all the same to me."</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Nine Bells district takes its name for the nine temples found in the heart of the district. Since these temples cater to the sick and the poor, this district draws the hungry, the diseased, and the destitute to its streets. Before the walls were raised here, Nine Bells was a place of great wealth-a community favored by those rich citizens who wanted to escape the clamor of the city. However, after it was annexed along with Blister and the Boneyard, the estates were abandoned and the folks fled to Stonehammer or Elftown to escape the flood of destitute people that washed into the place. Now, Nine Bells is the worst part of the city and is ever a source of embarrassment for the city's elite.

                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        With rotting estates, old vineyards now overrun by tents and wooden shacks, sagging rowhouses, and communities of tents, Nine Bells decays even while the rest of the city grows strong. The businesses, such as they are,
                        cater to darker interests, including dreaming halls, sinister taverns, fighting pits, and disease-ridden brothels. Huddled in one corner of this district are nine great temples, raised long ago, but faced, on all sides, by poverty, despair, and the worst sorts of people imaginable. Called the Divine Knot, a few of these temples have been abandoned, while the rest keep small staffs of dedicated servants who soldier on to fight the misery plaguing this district.

                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        As one might expect, Nine Bells' streets are muddy lanes and narrow alleys, all filthy and most worming through the press of decaying buildings. Closest to the temples, the muddy roads gain cobbles, typically clean and free of debris.

                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        Nine Bells is the bottom of the barrel, so to speak, and it welcomes anyone who has nowhere else to go. Humans, dwarves, tieflings, halflings, gnomes, and even a few half-orcs scratch out an existence in this wretched mire. Despair is strong here and it drives many
                        of its people to commit unspeakable acts to survive. Drugs, prostitution, and even slavery can all be found here.

                        A dead dog rotting in the streets, a swarm of rats cornering a gaunt gnome in a darkened alley, a hideous crone hobbling under the weight of her scavenged scraps, a gang of children armed with sharp knives and hungry eyes, and a robed priest swinging a smoking censer to chase away the spirits can all be found in Nine Bells.

                        A fecal stench hangs in the air, mixed with the equally nauseating odors of vomit, rot, and rubbish. People here are unclean and their odors mingle with that of the befouled air to create a symphony of noxious odors. Nearest to the temples, the air grows a bit more tolerable thanks to incense and the modicum of respect the people show the men and women of the cloth.

                        carcass, the splash of effluvia, and the whisper of a threat.

                    <p>
                        Stonehammer occupies the southern half of the inner city, and it wraps around High Hall up to the Dwarfroad. Like Elftown, Stonehammer is home to the wealthy citizens of Overlook, specifically the dwarves. Since this district is cleaner, safer, and more exclusive than other parts of the city, great deal of resentment exists toward the folks of Stonehammer from those of lower means and status.
                    </p>

                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        Stonehammer is the most dwarven of districts, and its buildings are grand, sweeping, and magnificent to behold. Towers that thrust up from lower levels rival those found in High Hall in terms of height and grandeur. Since space is at a premium, the dwarves here have built upward. The wealthiest citizens live in the aeries, while servants, low-born dwarves, and all those who support the sumptuous lifestyles of the
                        elite dwell in the 'Dark-the bowels of Stonehammer.

                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        The towers feature wide, sturdy bridges of stone, each fitted with high railings to prevent accidents and equipped with everburning torches for safety. In the 'Dark, the roads are tight and twisting, threading around the towers' bases, and plunged in nearly perpetual darkness.

                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        Stonehammer is exclusively a dwarven district and nondwarves are not permitted to live here. Other races often work in the 'Dark, but even they must keep their residences outside the district. Folk here are wealthy and powerful, and they represent the best the city has to offer.

                        None; the air is clean, although a breeze might push the fetid odors from the rest of the city, but such occasions are rare and brief. In the 'Dark, dust, sweat, and wood smoke fill the air, tinged with a faint chemical smell.

                    <p>
                        Tradetown is a melting pot of all races, cultures, and occupations. In many ways, Tradetown is a lot like the Blister, but it has been established for longer and it has a mix of fabulous wealth and appalling poverty. Tradetown, as one might expect, is a commercial and retail district, where merchants, tradesfolk, and prospectors come to do business. Most middle-tier business-inclined people have homes here and gather in coffee
                        houses, upscale bars, and bathhouses to do business. In stark contrast to the bustling commerce, Tradetown is also home to a powerful thieving guild named the Lost Ones. A clandestine organization, they have agreements with nearly all the major enterprises here, offering protection (or rather exemption) from thievery and the promise to leave their customers alone.

                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        Tradetown is a hodgepodge of stone buildings (many of dwarven architecture), wooden structures, warehouses, shops, inns, taverns, and everything and anything a person might want in a city of this size.

                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        Tradetown is every bit as cramped as the Blister and in some ways more so for the vendors and hawkers crowding the streets. Moving merchandise into Tradetown is a chore and often requires porters rather than wagons to transport anything of size. The roads are cobbled, but alleys and side-streets might be muddy and covered in rubbish.

                        Tradetown is home to a dizzying number of people,
                        from elves and eladrin to lumbering half-orcs and goliaths. Humans and gnomes rub elbows in taverns, while dwarves of low character might engage in backroom deals with sinister tieflings.

Shady men and women walk the streets, eyes in constant motion as they search for new marks, while grifters and charlatans peddle cure-alls or use trickery to part their customers from their coin. Urchins run through the alleys, leading visitors through the safer parts of Tradetown, while disguised halflings lead other visitors to the nastier corners, where the travelers can find beatings and robberies instead of their destinations.

                        Not a true district, Shantytown clings to the back of the city like festering boil. Shantytown is a wretched maze of tents, shacks, and rotting wooden buildings, and it is home to the poorest and most desperate of people that have nowhere else to go. Most of Shantytown's people are refugees from other lands, victims of tragedy and circumstance, or exiles who keep a low profile so they can go about their wicked business without attracting attention. Thus, Shantytown's people are beggars, destitute farmers, maimed adventurers, undead, necromancers, cultists, and worse, all thrown together in one of the most
                        desperate spots in the region.

            <h3>Brindol Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Brindol has a smaller population than it
                did before the events of the original Red Hand of Doom. But the last
                decade has brought mild prosperity to the region,
                with only bandits (such as Sinruth and his ilk) disturbing
                the peace.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h5>Population:</h5>
                6,700; another 1,000 live within
                a five-mile radius of the town itself. The people of
                Brindol are mostly humans, half-elves, and dwarves.
                The town's population swells by several hundred
                whenever some connected halfling clans known as
                "the river people" are in town.

            <p>
                <h5>Government:</h5>
                A town has a council, two-thirds
                of whom are hereditary landlords and the remainder
                of whom are guildmasters from the city's
                important trade guilds. Lord Warden Harrik Orenna
                is the public face of the council and commander of
                the city militia.

            <p>
                <h5 class="fullpage">Defense:</h5>
                The city has 200 soldiers under arms
                at all times, with about one-quarter on duty at any
                given time. In times of crisis, the Lord Warden has
                access to another 200 well-equipped but poorly
                trained soldiers by calling up the militia.

                beautiful valley. Sayre holds a university and
                a large number of artisans, making it a popular site for
                those who deal in either information or fine art.

                <h5>Population:</h5>
                Approximately 12,000, including
                almost 1,500 students attending the University. Most
                inhabitants are human, elf, eladrin, or halfling. Some
                dwarves also live in Sayre, although they tend to keep
                to themselves.

            <div class="fullpage">
                <h5>Government:</h5>
                Sayre is governed by Lord Divian
                Torrance, a politically astute nobleman adept at playing
                different factions of the city against each other.
                Power resides with Lord Torrance, as well as the Artisan's
                Guild and the University's archdean.

            <div class="fullpage">
                <h5>Defense:</h5>
                The Guards of the March are a force of
                100 soldiers led by General Alvro Taramin that have
                little to do other than patrol the safer sections in and
                around the city. Most merchants, guilds, and noble
                families have their own mercenary guards that protect
                their property and work together when danger
                appears. In a time of crisis, General Taramin has the
                authority to call on any house with its own private
                guard to cede command of their troops directly to
                him. Fortunately, he has never had to do so, but if he
                were, he could call over 2,000 troops. With a cliff, a
                lake, and steep hills protecting three sides of Sayre, the
                Guards of the March spend much of their time outside
                the city patrolling the farming areas to the west.

                to the city's finest artists and artisans, and is the place to
                go if you're looking for jewelers or sculptors. Low Mountain
                is home to most of Sayre's dwarves, and hidden

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Sayre is built in a small, defensible valley. Steep hills
                to the north provide protection from overland armies
                and make excellent spots for small defensive guard
                posts. The Lake of Songs sits uphill to the northwest of
                the city. Dammed at its outflow to help control floods,
                this lake is used year-round for fishing and recreation;
                it is extraordinarily beautiful and the subject of many
                paintings and tapestries by local artists. The Singing
                River descends from the lake and splits briefly into
                three branches as it flows through Sayre. A tall cliff
                guards Sayre's eastern flank, dropping 200 feet to the
                valley below. The only direction an invading army
                could easily approach Sayre from is the west, across
                the farms and fields, and guard towers alert the town
                to any threat approaching from that direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before Sayre was built, the city of Auger stood on this
                site, built over 400 years ago as a refuge for exiled diviners.
                A diviner named Auglos and his apprentices were
                driven from the island of Nefelus after he prophesized
                a local noble's death and was blamed by the man's relatives.
                After fleeing the family's wrath, Auglos settled
                in this particularly beautiful and defensible valley to
                continue his research into divination and communication.
                More academics and sages slowly joined him, and a
                small city - Auger - grew up around his tower.
            </p>
            <!--
            <p>
                Auglos's skill as a craftsman began to bring him
                fame. At first he specialized in divinatory devices
                such as crystal balls. His masterpiece was a huge glass
                globe the color of the evening sky, a device that could
                transmit messages thousands of miles and even across
                planes if individually crafted receiving mirrors were
                first attuned to it. Auglos sold the communication
                mirrors for extremely high prices, typically to merchant
                consortiums or the rulers of more prosperous
                city states. His customers never knew that if he chose,
                he could hear and see everything that passed through
                one of his glass devices, and that he also sold much of
                the information he obtained through his eavesdropping,
                resulting in an even more profitable secondary
                business in the espionage trade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Auglos knew that his glass globe created psychic
                ripples in the Astral Sea when it was used, but he
                didn't consider it a problem; how likely was it that
                anyone would be bothered? He should have done
                more research. His master glass, the device attuned to
                all the others that allowed him to listen in on so many
                fascinating conversations, created ripples near the
                githyanki city of Tu'narath, and psychic debris from
                the glass's communication soon caught the githyanki's
                attention. The githyanki quickly determined that
                someone on the mortal realm was using the energy of
                the plane to fuel a communication device. Paranoid
                in the extreme, within three months, the Lich Queen
                Vlaakith herself named this device the Bitter Glass
                and decreed that the psychic pollution must be eliminated.
                Her knights quickly carried out her orders.
            </p>
            <p>
                The raid on Auger was terrible to behold. Githyanki
                dragonriders shattered the town's dam, flooding the
                streets with water and mud, then proceeded to pick
                off fleeing citizens one by one. By the end of the night,
                Auglos and his assistants were dead, and the Bitter
                Glass was shattered and buried under the broken
                tower that housed it. Auger's remains were looted and
                abandoned, and survivors from the raid left the area,
                never aware of the reason behind the attack.

            <h3>Rebuilding</h3>
            <p>
                Shepherds moved back onto the site within sixty years,
                but without a dam on the Singing River, the site of
                the former city had become a flood plain whenever it
                rained. Finally, dwarven engineers rebuilt the dam on
                the Lake of Songs, and Sayre was built where Auger
                once stood. The level of the land had risen after so
                many years of floods, and none of the old buildings
                were still visible above ground. All residents of the
                modern city know that there is an old city beneath the
                streets, and some families dug down to take advantage
                of a pre-made cellar by digging through the roofs of
                old buildings, but enough people caused cave-ins or
                unleashed monsters that it's now illegal to dig into the
                undercity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sayre is ruled by a wily half-elven politician
                named Lord Divian Torrance, and under his direction
                the city goes out of its way to attract the finest artists
                and craftsmen in the land. As a result, many wealthy
                families call Sayre home, and all of these have their
                own mercenary security forces to protect their
                houses and workshops. Not much of a public militia
                is needed, although a small force controlled by Torrance's
                good friend General Taramin remains active.
                The public militia is subsidized by a public ordinance
                crafted by the wily Lord Torrance. Each family above
                a certain income level must commit a number of
                troops from their own personal guard units to the
                city's defense. This makes the city's safety the concern
                of all the wealthiest families, although it requires a
                charismatic and skillful general to keep all the different
                house troops in line. Sayre boasts a small theater
                and a large university that attracts scholars from cities
                across this corner of the mortal realm. For such a
                small city, Sayre is a shining beacon of light. Lord Torrance
                fully intends to keep it that way.

            <h3>Sayre Districts</h3>
            <section id="Fisher District">
                <h4>The Fisher District</h4>
                <p>
                    Located at the northern tip of the city, this low-lying
                    area is prone to floods during the spring rains. Fishermen
                    and fishmongers who live here ply the lake for
                    their trade and live in raised huts. It's possible to buy
                    fish in the market district, but the freshest fish can
                    be bought by those brave enough to come north up
                    muddy streets and buy the catch coming off the boats.
                    There isn't much crime in the Fisher District; most
                    fishermen have large families, and they police their
                    own neighborhood with stout clubs and many friends.
                    Interestingly, this is the one neighborhood that isn't
                    defined by the breaks of the river. Fishermen live on
                    both outer shores and both inner ones, crossing the
                    rivers in small boats or over swaying rope bridges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ketch's Catch:</strong> This small fish stand has a reputation
                    for bringing in some of the largest, tastiest
                    fish in the lake. More importantly, the stall is run by
                    Gloriana Ketch. She makes a business of tracking city
                    gossip while her husband is off fishing, and she's a
                    good source for anyone who wants to know the latest
                    city rumors about the nobles or anyone of importance.

                <h4>Prospect Hill</h4>
                <p>
                    This residential neighborhood holds the majority of
                    the city's grand estates and mansions. Flanked by
                    rivers on either side, the low hill rises gradually over
                    the rest of Sayre. This neighborhood was the heart
                    of the ancient City of Seers. All the richest citizens
                    of Sayre live here. There is virtually no crime here,
                    and private mercenary units ensure that the neighborhood
                    stays safe. Unsavory types moving through
                    Prospect Hill should expect to be challenged several
                    times, especially after dark.

                <p>
                    <strong>The Pillar of Hope Reborn:</strong>
                    This ostentatious
                    memorial is a 60-foot-tall pillar with an eternal, magical
                    flame atop it. According to the plaque this marks
                    the spot of "Auglos the Wise's tower in Auger, first
                    founder of the city that became Sayre." It's not particularly
                    accurate, being located almost 200 feet from
                    Telicanthus's mansion and the actual site of the tower,
                    but it's a good meeting spot for young couples on
                    Prospect Hill who wish to go courting after dark. The
                    beggars of Sayre have a yearly competition, awarding
                    50 gp to anyone of their ilk who can surreptitiously
                    climb the pillar and extinguish the flame. Guardsmen
                    usually find crippled and dead beggars under
                    the pillar for weeks afterward.

                    <strong>Telicanthus's Mansion:</strong>
                    Marked by gate pillars
                    boasting lanterns made from exquisitely blown glass,
                    this mansion was bought by Telicanthus and renovated
                    after the former owner moved south. It's one of
                    the social epicenters of Prospect Hill, and servants
                    and guests enter and exit it during most daylight
                    hours (or later, if Telicanthus is hosting a party.) A
                    competent and wily butler (Telicanthus's <span class="hidden">sociopathic</span>
                    servant Pennel) monitors all guests and stops anyone
                    who doesn't belong. Telicanthus's guards are notably
                    polite as they escort interlopers off the property. <span class="hidden">
                    Unlike other parts of the city, none

                <h4>The Glassworks</h4>
                <p>
                    This neighborhood on the eastern edge of Prospect
                    Hill is home to the city's artists. Sayre attracts many
                    of the finest craftsmen to this area. The wide roads
                    are lined with shops and stores, and are roughly
                    grouped by type of business. Businesses selling expensive
                    goods, such as goldmakers and jewelers, typically
                    have their own security. There's an atmosphere of
                    camaraderie in the Glassworks, and in the event of
                    trouble, all locals pitch in to solve the problem. Many
                    artists and shop owners live in apartments located
                    over their stores.

                    <strong>The River Jewel:</strong>
                    This is one of the finest inns
                    in the entire city, with superb service and prices to
                    match. Rooms are large, secure, beautifully decorated,
                    and extremely comfortable. The staff offers
                    any amenity a guest might want, and will send out
                    for food or items not offered in-house, and the chefs
                    are renowned for truly delicious meals. Rooms here
                    cost 15 gp a night, an outrageous amount compared
                    to other inns in the city, but rooms seldom go empty.

                    is as knowledgeable a dwarven craftsman

                    enough. He charges high prices for high quality art, but
                    is happy to talk to visitors.

                    <strong>The University of Sayre:</strong>
                    Founded by a priestess of Ioun who was appalled with
                    the lack of learning among most people she met, the
                    university is a bustling school of higher learning that
                    teaches everything from agriculture to esoteric magical
                    theory. Students tend to be young and from out of
                    town, as the university recruits the best and brightest
                    from many different areas. The university is often
                    viewed as an excellent finishing school for noble sons
                    and daughters, and it isn't uncommon for loyal servants
                    to be seen dragging their drunken masters back
                    home after a rowdy night in the Dregs.

                    <strong>The Tankard of Ink:</strong>
                    This is a popular tavern
                    for students who want to be in stumbling distance of
                    their rooms after drinking, and for those who don't
                    care for the Dregs. Many professors from the university
                    have adopted the tankard as their own, as well.
                    This is the place to come if you want a philosophical
                    debate instead of a fistfight.

                <h4>Low Mountain</h4>
                <p>
                    While most races have integrated nicely in Sayre,
                    the dwarven inhabitants tend to keep to themselves.
                    Low Mountain is a neighborhood of high stone walls
                    and twisting streets. Non-dwarves have trouble finding
                    places in Low Mountain, as none of the streets
                    are labeled, and none of the buildings are numbered
                    or named. As they say, "If you need to know where
                    you are in Low Mountain, you probably shouldn't be
                    there."
                    The area is safe, with squads formed exclusively
                    of dwarven guards patrolling the streets after
                    nightfall, but it's not particularly exciting to nondwarves.
                    That changes if you're a dwarf, or have the
                    trust of one. Wonderful restaurants, clever sages,
                    and master craftsmen hide within the featureless
                    buildings. Some dwarves will accept a bribe to guide
                    outsiders to the right place and introduce them to the
                    right contact.

                    This small shop contains
                    two dwarven brothers, Andor and Toris Scrollstone,
                    sages who specialize in maps and locations. Commonly
                    consulted by explorers into the Underdark and
                    merchants who have long journeys ahead of them,
                    the Scrollstone brothers are the people to consult if
                    one wishes to learn more about Sayre's undercity.
                    They have old maps showing what
                    buildings used to be where.

                    This is the heart of the city for everyone but the
                    wealthiest citizens. The streets are full of people
                    from all walks of life, and any non-exotic object (as
                    well as many exotic and rare ones) can be purchased
                    here. Whether you're looking for ink from a giant
                    octopus or the feather from an angel, you're likely to
                    be able to buy it - or something that the seller swears
                    is authentic - somewhere in the market. This area is
                    characterized by narrow streets, tiny shop stalls, yelling
                    shopkeeps, and a multitude of different bazaars.
                    Due to the university, the market contains a great
                    number of booksellers and scrollmakers. Debt-ridden
                    sages who have been forced to sell their library
                    crouch side by side with itinerant thieves peddling
                    stolen spellbooks.

                    regulars in the market who consider it good luck to
                    throw her a few coins when they pass by. In return,
                    she is unfailingly friendly to anyone who doesn't treat
                    her with contempt. Agnes is always happy to pass a
                    few minutes chatting with strangers, and she's the
                    best resource for finding something quickly, as she
                    has a good memory for what merchant has what sort
                    of item.

                    by wide pens, warehouses and slaughterhouses,
                    and stockyards where herd animals are sold. On
                    the rare occasions when exotic animals or monsters
                    are brought into the city, they're kept in Downwind

                <p>
                    The March looks almost like a military parade ground.
                    This area was once the preferred spot for Lord Limbic
                    the Scholar, a former ruler who had an obsession with
                    statuary and monuments. As a result, he spent a great
                    deal of the city's coffers on self-aggrandizing monuments.
                    More than two dozen great statues, triumphal
                    arches to non-existent battles, and other spectacular
                    monuments stand in this area. They're starting to
                    decay somewhat due to a lack of interest in keeping
                    them pristine, but they define this section of the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Dangle:</strong>
                    This was originally named "The
                    Triumphal Arch of Limbic the Gracious" until it was
                    turned into the city's location for public execution and
                    punishment. Murderers are hanged from the 30-foot-tall
                    arch and left to dangle for a few days. Public
                    stocks are also located here, for punishments of a less
                    severe nature. Public executions are rare in Sayre,
                    and the city hasn't seen one in months.

                <p>
                    <strong>The Guard Barracks:</strong>
                    Sayre doesn't require a
                    large standing army thanks to the proliferation of
                    private guards, but the one hundred full-time city
                    militia the city employs are stationed in this gray, austere
                    building that is also known for its statue of Lord
                    Limbic standing on the roof.

                    Most of the city's entertainment is located in this
                    rundown, old section of the city. Dancehalls, seedy
                    taverns, pawn shops, breweries, and comfort houses
                    all crowd its narrow alleys. The area isn't immediately
                    dangerous to visitors, as thugs paid by local businesses
                    roam the streets with the intent of keeping people
                    safe in the theory that "a live customer is a paying
                    customer." They've been known to look the other way
                    after dark, though, especially for a sizeable bribe.

                    This tiny inn sits above
                    a loud and raucous tavern. The namesake dog has
                    been stuffed by a taxidermist and magically animated;
                    it staggers around the tavern to greet visitors.
                    The Inn of the Ugly Dog has cheap ale, mostly clean
                    rooms, good prices, and an ever-changing array of
                    owners as the property is a common stake in the

                    These are the slums of Sayre, and the area where the
                    city's undesirables live. Beggars and unsavory visitors
                    gather here, along with anyone too poor to pay for
                    lodging elsewhere. Abandoned and crumbling warehouses
                    hold rotting goods or illegal and smuggled
                    property. The streets are narrow and twisting, made
                    slick by constant mist that rises from the waterfalls.
                    Dark and smoke-stained buildings house beggars
                    with wet coughs from the constant moisture. Rats
                    scuttling through glassless windows provide one of
                    the few free food sources for the locals. It isn't an
                    attractive place to live, and visitors who show weakness
                    are likely to be preyed upon by the locals.

                    Sayre have taken over one of them, reinforcing it and
                    using it as a temporary headquarters.

                    <strong>Lowbridge:</strong>
                    The local temple to Tiamat, worshipped

                    an abandoned warehouse across the street from the last
                    bridge in Sayre. Beggars congregate in this area each
                    morning before heading out across the city. The beggars,
                    strangely, won't speak to anyone while near Lowbridge.
                    They won't ask for money until they've gone to other parts
                    of town, as they're careful not to draw attention to the
                    activities of the Filth King (leader of the city's beggars).

    <h2>Ancient History</h2>
    <p>
        The scattered human towns and villages of the land now known as the Elsir Vale grew up along the Dawn Way,
        an important east-west trade road linking the heavily settled lands that lie northwest across the Endless Plains with the exotic kingdoms
        and goods of the coastal lands lying to the southeast.
    </p>
    <img src="../places/Ancient Dwarven Kingdom.png" class="left"/>
    <p>
        Much of the Dawn Way was built by an ancient dwarven kingdom that spanned the Wyrmsmoke and Giantshield Mountains
        more than a thousand years ago. While their kingdom is long gone, their roads, bridges, and cisterns remain in use to this day. After the kingdom passed, the presence
        of various monsters and raiders kept traffic along the Dawn Way light for many years; few caravans dared the long and dangerous trek.
        Few humans lived in Elsir Vale during those years - only scattered settlements of druidic folk who tapped into the rich planar magic of the Vale.
        In the end, however, they left behind little more than grassy barrows and stone circles on the hilltops.
    </p>
    <img src="../places/Rhestilor.jpg" title="Rhestilor" class="right"/>
    <p>
        About five hundred years ago, the nearby city of Rhest came to control the vale and a large swath of land north of the
        Giantshield Mountains as well. Soldiers from Rhest secured the roads all the way to Dennovar and beyond,
        creating a safe passage for trade. More and more traders traveled the Dawn Way, and the kingdom of Rhestilor grew wealthy
        on the tariffs exacted from the passing merchants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under the kingdom's shield, the towns along the Dawn Way - Brindol, Dennovar,
        Talar, Terrelton, and the rest - grew up from tiny hamlets or lonely soldiers' posts to flourishing human settlements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The kingdom of Rhestilor eventually collapsed under civil strife, monstrous incursions, and magical blights. Almost two hundred years and fifty
        years ago, the city of Rhest was burned by a savage horde that descended swiftly from out of the Wyrmsmoke Mountains.
        Although the warriors of Rhestilor killed much of the horde, the city was abandoned and the already weakened kingdom broken. The locks and canals
        surrounding Rhest fell into disrepair, and the Blackfens Swamp swallowed the ruined city.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the years after the kingdom's fall, the towns of Elsir Vale came to look after themselves. Most of the local lords still held titles derived
        from the old kingdom of Rhestilor. While everyone knew that the kings of Rhestilor were long dead, no new realm arose
        in the Vale.
