    <span class="description">
        Gilgathorn was an accomplished elven bounty hunter from the Golden Plains operating out of
        Dornaithos. When Sarshan posted a price on our heroes' heads he attempted to collect. He
        realized the threat the party represented and took time to study them -
        monitoring them when they fought other enemies. He waited until they were sufficiently
        worn down by these encounters and his own traps before attacking, pretending to help them
        against other enemies if it looked like someone else might successfully collect the bounty.
        In the end he ambushed them in the aftermath of their confrontation with Fangren but they
        were still too much for him.
