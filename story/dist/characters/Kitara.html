            Kitara was stolen from her Shadar-kai parents - members of the Winter Court - as a child by the forces of the Fomorian lord Cachlain (The Stone-Skinned King).
            Drafted into the Fomori legion, she was raised to be an elite warrior and an arcane assassin. At puberty she was taken by the coven of Howling Hags in service
            to Cachlain and multilated in perverse Fomori rituals - they took her eye and part of her soul but grafted a new eye and part of new soul in its place. The
            ritual twisted her, but also granted her greater powers. Feeling betrayed by this violation Kitara fled Cachlain's service and ended up working as a mercenary
            under Sarshan before leaving his service as well in disgust. Now she acts against her former masters in a mission of revenge.
