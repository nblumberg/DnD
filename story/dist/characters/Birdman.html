    <p>
      An aged human
      male who was locked in a cell in the Karak mines.
      His lined face sported a snow-white beard to
      match his fringe of hair. He wore the garb of a simple
      desert peasant, and appeared to have not been there
      long. Seven yellow canaries perched on his shoulders
      and hopped around his cell. The Birdman whistled and
      chirped at his tiny charges. When spoken to, he simply nodded
      and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered no resistance and allowed himself
      to be led about. He accepted food and water,
      smiling and nodding when spoken to but otherwise ignoring
      the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a night's rest our heroes woke to find the Birdman gone,
      tracks and yellow feathers leading out into a sandstorm.
