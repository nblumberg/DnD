            The female gnome Brandowen Entromiel ruled over the mercantile settlement
            of Dornaithos, which trades both fine craftwork
            (including goods from the Feywild) and everyday
            items.
        </p>
        <p>
            A former lover of Lechonero's during his smuggling days,
            they suffered a hostile break up and Lechonero made off with her
            pet bear Balugh.
        </p>
        <p>
            She had dealings with the Elsir Consortium,
            a group of merchants from the Elsir Vale, and with
            traders in every major settlement across this corner of
            the mortal world. Gregarious and shrewd, Brandowen
            was well known for her business acumen and efficiency.
            It was rumored she was not afraid to resort to bribery if
            doing so would get a project or deal finished quickly.
            Brandowen wanted Dornaithos's fortunes to continue
            and thought running the alliance was a way to make
            herself more prominent and secure better deals for
            Dornaithos to provide war material.
        </p>
        <p>
            She is now a leading member of the Gatekeepers.
