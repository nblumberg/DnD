    <span class="description">
        Caliandra of the Stagrunners was an ancient elf
        who could trace her descendants back to elves who migrated
        from the Feywild almost eleven of her generations
        ago. She lead not only her own tribe, the Stagrunners (of which Lechonero is a part),
        but had also been named the voice of all the
        tribes that live in the wild reaches to the north and
        west of Elsir Vale. All told, she spoke for a group of
        twenty-five tribes.
        Fierce, wild, and haughty, she was stubborn and
        opinionated, and wasn't afraid to engage in a protracted
        argument about aspects of history that most
        people had long forgotten. She held influence
        with many gnome, elf, and eladrin leaders, much
        as a respected grandmother and advisor might.
        She leaned toward solutions that provided the
        most safety for the most people. She seemed to expect
        subservience, making her nearly intolerable
        to deal with.
        One of the naysayers of the Gatekeepers, Caliandra
        automatically assumed her age and experience made
        her the voice everyone else should listen to. She talked
        loudly, fiercely, and often, but she didn't mince
        words. She got to her point quickly. She favored action
        of some sort, but was like a ship in need of a pilot. If
        given a course that she could approve of - something
        that will let her lead her people to glorious battle
        against the invaders who have killed so many of her
        people - she would fight honorably and without hesitation.
        But she demanded respect, and was fond of rejecting
        someone else's idea out of hand, only to bring it back
        up minutes later as a concept all her own.
