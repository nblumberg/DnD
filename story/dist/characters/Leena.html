        <span class="description">
            Leena, a shadar-kai war witch worked to train
            combat casters in the mercenary camps of Umbraforge. She was a follower
            of Sarshan and a former ally of Modra, but her
            sense of honor caused her to break with the dark
            creeper when he decided to work behind Sarshan's
            back.
            The shadar-kai witch wears a black cloak edged with
            adamantine beads, and she keeps her long hair plaited to
            hang down her back. Gold piercings line her ears and lower
            lip, and a black starburst tattoo encloses her right eye.
            When in Umbraforge, Leena sought out the Dusk Wardens to help
            them track down Modra. She felt that honor decreed Modra
            should die, but that Sarshan would make her former ally's
            death slow and painful while the Dusk Wardens would make it quick.
