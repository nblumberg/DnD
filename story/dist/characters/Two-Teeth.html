        <span class="description">
            Two-Teeth, named after the teeth he lost after being
            kicked by a wild horse, is a half-orc barbarian who was
            traveling through Brindol at the time of the race.
            Spying an opportunity for profit and being accustomed
            to long-distance running since childhood, he
            saw it as a chance for some easy money to pay his
            way across the land.
            Two-Teeth is a stereotypical brute. If he thinks he
            can get away with it, he would have no compunction about
            tackling, beating, knocking out, or otherwise interfering
            with another runner in order to get ahead.
