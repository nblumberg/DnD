        <span class="description">
            Child of the prestigious Stagrunner clan of the elves of Endless Plains, Lechonero was trained in the ways of the wild by Thrand U'Squiel to
            help guard the borders against the orc hordes to the south. When Thrand travelled to Elsir Vale as a member of the Dawn Wardens Lechonero made
            frequent visits to his mentor. Taking advantage of his frequent trips along the Dawn Way, Lechonero's clan elder Caliandra used him as a trading
            envoy to the eastern city of Dornaithos, the first trading post of Astrazalian fully in the world. When Thrand returned to the Stagrunners he
            charged Lechonero with looking after his daughters Kallista and Karrion. Recently in Dornaithos, Lechonero had an affair with
            Brandowen ("Brandi") Entromiel - the master of that mercantile settlement and as aggressive a lover as she was a saleswoman. In a heated moment
            that ended their affair Lechonero inadvertently absconded with her bonded bear companion from the Feywild and he has been avoiding her ever since.
