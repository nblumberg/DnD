        <span class="description">
            The 8-year-old son of Kartenix the
            guard captain of Brindol, Thurann was kidnapped by Sinruth. Thurann
            is a brave, observant boy. Outwardly, he handled his
            ordeal better than many of the adults. He even stole
            food for Jalissa and himself.
            Thurann has some skills you wouldn't expect the
            son of a watch captain to have. Despite his small size,
            he is very athletic with a skill at thievery. And while he
            can't really fight, he's brave when it comes to climbing
            or handling other hazards.
