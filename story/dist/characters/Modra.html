  <section class="description">
    A lieutenant of the black market arms dealer Sarshan, Modra went rogue and sold aid and arms to Tusk and the Orog invasion
    against orders for a personal profit. He tried to aid Tusk by selling arms to the goblins inside Elsir Vale and conning Sinruth into attacking Brindol.
    At odds with his former employer, Modra tried to destroy Sarshan before he could hunt him down.
    Sarshan stumbled across the Dusk Wardens following Modra and encouraged them to do his dirty work for him.
