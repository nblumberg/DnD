        Alys was a bar maid at the Antler and Thistle in Brindol until Sinruth's troops attacked. The Dusk Wardens'
        heroism inspired her to leave in search of adventure and has been working as a courier ever since. When she
        brought word of Amyria's awakening in Brindol's Hall of Great Valor she was kidnapped by the Lost Ones until the
        Dusk Wardens rescued her.
