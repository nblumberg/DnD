    <span class="description">
        Dorion is an elven ranger from the woodlands near Brindol,
        venturing out in the world and seeking to make a
        name for himself. He was a contestant in the Brindol race to
        see whether he's truly capable in character and ability
        of taking up the life of an adventurer.
        Dorion isn't a cheater. He has a strong moral sense
        that may even lead him to help people who get into
        serious trouble near him.
