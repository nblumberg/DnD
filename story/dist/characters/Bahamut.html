        Bahamut is the god of justice, protection, nobility, and honor.
        Sometimes called the Platinum Dragon.
        His dominion is the realm of Celestia.
        Lawful good paladins often revere him, and metallic dragons worship him as the first of their kind.
        Monarchs are crowned in his name. He commands his followers thus:
        <ul>
            <li>Uphold the highest ideals of honor and justice.</li>
            <li>Be constantly vigilant against evil and oppose it on all fronts.</li>
            <li>Protect the weak, liberate the oppressed, and defend just order.</li>
        </ul>
        Bahamutan priests are called Justicars.
        His nemesis is the goddess Tiamat, who is also is sister.
