        <span class="description">
            <p>
                Once, he reigned supreme.
            </p>
            <p>
                General Zithiruun was a great hero - one of the
                most respected military leaders of a militant race.
                From the great city of Tu'narath, he led armies of the
                githyanki on raids across the Astral Sea, and into a
                dozen different regions and kingdoms of the mortal
                realm. From the deck of the astral galleon Siun'kara
                or the back of Rathoraiax, his great red dragon steed,
                Zithiruun proved an unstoppable force - a champion
                among a race of champions. Even Vlaakith, the
                fearsome githyanki lich queen, acknowledged his
                greatness, heaped great praise upon him.
                And then the great General Zithiruun took on a
                foe beyond even his own prowess.
            </p>
            <p>
                That it was a dragon, a dragon far greater than
                Rathoraiax, everyone knows, but tales of the confrontation
                differ as to whether it was a black wyrm,
                one of the fearsome scourge dragons, or something
                else entirely. But while not everyone knows precisely
                what it was Zithiruun faced, everyone knows what
                happened as a result.
            </p>
            <p>
                A hideous burst of something - acid, perhaps, or
                pure necrotic energy - ripped the life from the red
                dragon Rathoraiax, shredding flesh and obliterating
                entire portions of the beast. And it was this attack
                that felled Zithiruun as well. It stripped the strength
                from his limbs, rotted bits of flesh and even weakened
                bone. Any lesser warrior would have died in that hideous
                moment, but the general clung to life through
                sheer force of stubborn, malignant will.
            </p>
            <p>
                It took years for Zithiruun to retrain and reinvigorate
                his broken body. Even by the time he encountered our heroes, he was a shadow of
                what he once was - weaker in body, far less sound in
                mind. His own people had all but turned their backs
                on him; though his great achievements prevented them
                from executing or exiling him utterly, they scorn his
                weakness and hold him in contempt for allowing himself
                and his mount to be so soundly defeated. By the siege of Overlook,
                Zithiruun served as a lowly operative of Tu'narath's
                forces and he led only lesser warriors into battle
                while answering to and obeying githyanki who would
                once have feared even to speak in his presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zithiruun's native powers had mutated through
                his years of effort as he attempted to reinvigorate
                his body at the expense of his mental prowess. The
                ambition all githyanki share had been subsumed by
                a burning need to prove himself and to regain the
                position and the respect that were once his by right -
                even as he nursed a resentful hatred of the very people
                whose adulation he so desperately craved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zithiruun had been large for a githyanki, but since the
                destruction and atrophy of much of his musculature,
                he appeared almost impossibly tall and gaunt.
                Mixed with and attached to the traditional leathers of
                his people, he wore a contraption of braces and harnesses,
                constructed of leather straps and iron joints.
            </p>
            <p>
                These braces, supported at his shoulders and by a strap
                across his chest, ran the length of his left arm and left
                leg, as well as a portion of his right leg. It is the straps
                that gave those limbs rigidity; without them, they could
                scarcely move, and not support his weight. This harness
                also granted him full mobility; charged with both
                magic and psychic energy, it permited him motion and
                granted him strength he would otherwise lack.
            </p>
            <p>
                His flesh clung tightly to his skeleton and puckered
                away from old wounds, exposing muscle and even
                charred bone. His left cheek gaped open, revealing
                a bit of metal plate that replaced a fragment of skull.
                A leather strap held the left side of his jaw in place,
                replacing obliterated muscle.
            </p>
            <p>
                He appeared weak indeed, and in some ways he
                truly was. Yet Zithiruun wielded his great silver saber
                with an astonishing, impossible precision, and his
                eyes burned with loathing and ambition to shame even
                the other githyanki.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite his drive, General Zithiruun met his end at the
                hands of our heroes when he laid siege to Overlook with
                his mercenary army.
            </p>
