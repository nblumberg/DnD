        <p>
            Sinruth was a hobgoblin with greater aspirations than
            a life spent preying on the fringes of civilization. He
            listened closely at the campfires when his fathers
            and uncles told tales of the Red Hand of Doom, a
            mighty army that ran across the land like a scythe.
            And when he became an adult and a leader of his
            own band of hobgoblins, he found a cache of tunics
            and weapons left behind by that army. Sinruth felt
            his destiny calling. He declared himself the new
            Warlord of Sinruth's Hand (as he named the group),
            emblazoned every possible surface with a crudely
            painted, downward thrusting red hand insignia, and
            set about recruiting the massive army that he felt was
            his birthright.
        </p>
        <p>
            But starting an army wasn't as easy as those campfire
            tales led Sinruth to believe. Years passed with
            Sinruth's band eking out a meager existence in the
            wilderness. But slowly, he started to gain allies. A
            temporary bargain with some sinister, mischievous
            gnomes blossomed into a lasting friendship. The Red
            Hand's exploration of the mountains unearthed some
            undisturbed catacombs beneath the long-ruined
            Castle Rivenroar. Sinruth struck another bargain,
            and the undead guardians let the Red Hand move
            in, in exchange for periodic payment of kidnapped
            prisoners.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sinruth and the reconstituted Red Hand had a
            base and a growing reputation, but they were far from
            a mighty army. Modra conned Sinruth into attacking Brindol and
            stealing some relics from the original Red Hand invasion.
            He did so by pretending to be an "Emissary" from another remnant of
            the Red Hand and offered to join forces under Sinruth's
            banner and more than double Sinruth's fifty soldiers
            under arms if he proved himself in the attack on Brindol.
            During his attack, Sinruth took enough prisoners to keep the undead
            guardians of Rivenroar satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sinruth personally led the assault on Brindol, sacking
            Brindol's Hall of Great Valor, stealing back
            many of the museum pieces on display there. Sinruth
            brought back seven prisoners, despite the fact that the
            new Red Hand lost half its number in the attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sinruth died at the hands of the Dusk Wardens when they
            came to rescue the prisoners and retrieve the relics.
