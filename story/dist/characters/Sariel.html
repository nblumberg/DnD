        A heavily armed courier for a Brindolin merchant our heroes encountered in the Green Dragon
        in Talar. This slim female eladrin carried the weapons
        and armor of a warrior. She sat on her own,
        humming a tuneless song while nursing her ale.
        Though she was polite to anyone conversing with her,
        she was tightlipped as to her reasons for being in Talar.
        The other patrons ignored her, often while discussing
        spurious explanations for her presence.
        Lechnero spent the evening hitting on her.
