  <span class="description">
    Bernath was the owner of the Green Dragon in Talar.
    He was a jovial, portly human
    widower who welcomed one and all to his establishment.
    However, his cheery disposition was a front when our heroes met him,
    ill at ease in the presence of armed adventurers.
    Once he saw to their room, food, and drink,
    he avoided them whenever possible.
    Bernath and his son Niall were the only people in
    town who knew that Megan Swiftblade was staying with Falrinth
    at the Mottled Tower.
