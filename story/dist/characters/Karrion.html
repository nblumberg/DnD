        <span class="description">
            First child of Thrand U'Squiel (ranger of the Stagrunner elves) and a tiefling warlock, Karrion found little acceptance among her father's family as a tielfing. That and
            the general aloofness of the elves made her father distant, and in reaction Karrion strives to emulate her absent father, craving acceptance.
            She became a ranger who guards the sanctity of nature, a vegetarian and champion of animals. As a protector of the weak and the voiceless,
            Karrion constantly struggles against her infernal heritage, channeling that power to do good. Redeeming her evil nature has led her to use that
            energy to redeem others, most often her rebellious sister Kallista.
