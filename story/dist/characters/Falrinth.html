    <span class="description">
      Falrinth was the reclusive sage of the Mottled Tower in Talar and and old family friend of
      Megan Swiftblade. He was extremely untrusting and insular,
      his single-minded dedication to his work had turned him somewhat surly over the years.
      Serten acted as Falrinth's apprentice.
      The Mottled Tower was destroyed
      when Sarshan opened a portal to the Elemental Chaos underneath it in order to flood
      Talar with Blood Chaos and kill Megan. Thanks to our heroes' intervention
      Falrinth and Megan survived, even if his tower did not.
