            <p>
                The dwarves in the Wyvernwatch mountains southeast of Brindol have a number of mining communities. None have more than a few hundred people working and living there, but the
                various mines are quick to come to each other's aid. In total there are probably 2500 people in these villages, almost entirely dwarves. This is the area's only source of raw stone and metal ore.

            <h3>Marth Forest</h3>
            <p>
                This dense wood is northeast of Brindol. The Tiri Kitor call this forest home. These Elves & Eladrin are known to number over 1000, but no one can say for sure how many of them
                there are. These elusive people are known for their giant owl mounts and superior archery skills. This is the last place you want to go for wood or furs. The Tiri Kitor trade with others in nearby towns,
                but few outsiders are welcomed into their forest.

            <h3>Southwood</h3>
            <p>
                This light forest stretches from Dauth to Prosser, south of Brindol. It's been heavily hunted and thinned out. The greatest danger here is usually bandits in hiding.
                Occasionally, rumors spread about ghosts in the woods, but it's usually proven to be bandit tricks and traps to scare off good folk. There was actually a ghost in the woods some 40 years ago that killed
                a number of people. Bandits or ghosts, most people travel through the woods during the day and in large groups.

            <img src="../maps/Witchwood.jpeg" class="left"/>
            <p>
                This forest lies west of Brindol, bordered on three sides by mountains or swamp. It is the largest forest in the area. Most wood and hunting goods come from this area.
                The Tiri Kitor have a presence here, but don't protect it nearly as well as the Marth Forest. Most of this woodland is still wild, and home to all manner of beasts. Roads and humanoid trails generally
                skirt the edges of the forest. Rumors suggest that creatures from the Blackfens Swamp have begun to wander into the Witchwood.

            <p>
                The only other city of any significance in the region, Dennovar lies 100 miles east of Brindol on the Dawn Way. It too has an outer defensive wall of stone. Population 11,000.
                Dennovar has its share of farm land, but it also sits on a huge lake, Lake Ern. Seafood and water related products are common trade goods from Dennovar. Dennovar hasn't been attacked by anything
                significant in hundreds of years. In fact, several of the gates are in poor working order, despite the lessons learned by most of the Vale forty years ago. A merchant council is the governing body.

            <p>
                Once a prosperous city and center of the kingdom of Rhestilor, Rhest is now a half-drowned ruin slowly sinking into the Blackfens Swamp. At its peak, the surrounding lands were well tended fields with
                levies, irrigation systems, and were clear for miles. Centuries of erosion and lack of attention have turned the farmlands into swamp. Rice and soybean fields are now overgrown with twisted trees,
                poisonous vines, and are crawling with snakes, crocodiles, and worse. Civilized people abandoned the place long ago. The only intelligent beings there now are lizard folk, if you consider them
                intelligent.

            <p>
                Jarmaan Keep predates the nation of Rhestilor. It was built on the remains of an ancient dwarven keep over 500 hundred years ago. During the reign of Rhestilor, the village around the keep grew into a
                town, then a city. When that great nation fell apart, the commanding officer, Kerden Jarmaan, claimed the keep as his own. It's been in the Jarmaan family ever since, and at
                least one member of the Jarmaan family has sat on the council of Brindol, typically in a leadership position, without fail...

            <h3>Overlook Summary</h3>
            <p>
                This city of stone stands on the side of the Stonehome Mountains. Constructed as a haven for newly liberated dwarves from their former giant masters, Overlook has since outgrown its noble roots and become a haven for peoples all over the Elsir Vale and beyond.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h5>Population:</h5>
                12,250; about another 5,000 people live in small settlements scattered on the lower slopes. The people of Overlook are mostly dwarves, humans, and halflings, though pockets of dragonborn, tiefling, eladrin, and elf communities are isolated in their own ethnic neighborhoods. Overlook's importance as a trade center results in great numbers of travelers from faraway lands and of a wild assortment of races, cultures, and beliefs, lending the city its cosmopolitan atmosphere. Government: The Council of Elders, a group of five male and female dwarves, governs Overlook. Each is elected to office and serves a 10-year term. The dwarves see ruling as a burden and none relish the job, preferring to hand power off to someone else. Heading up the Council is the Great Elder, Morgoff Stonefirst, an aging dwarf who's ready to retire.
            </div>
            <p>
                One representative from each of the eight districts of Overlook attends the Council, serving as advisors and also to air the grievances of their particular constituencies. Although these individuals have the power to influence, they have no real authority in the city, though many are wealthy and powerful by means other than the office they hold.
            </p>
            <div class="fullpage">
                <h5>Defense:</h5>
                Overlook keeps a standing garrison of 150 warriors armed and ready for any threat. In times of trouble (such as now), Overlook can muster another 500 warriors from the local militia, and another 100 from the outlying settlements. At Bordrin's Watch, another 500 hundred warriors protect the mountain pass from within its steep walls and skyscraping towers.

            <p>
                The city of Overlook stands on the eastern slopes of
                the Stonehome Mountains, a hoary range of crumbling
                peaks as old as the world. The city's founding
                lies sometime far back in the mists of time, at a point
                after the dwarves in this region threw off the shackles
                of slavery and chased the giants and orcs west across
                the mountains at the end of the Age of Chains. Overlook,
                and the fastness of Bordrin's Watch, were raised
                to safeguard the liberated dwarf peoples and to be
                the first line of defense should their ancient enemies
                forget their defeat and seek to enslave the dwarves
                once more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since its founding, Overlook has never come under
                attack, though Bordrin's Watch has time and again,
                at least once every century. Overlook supplies the
                mountain pass with soldiers, supplies, and needed
                resources, ensuring the Watch is never without the
                goods they need to live up to their ancient responsibility.
                While doughty dwarf warriors hold the
                Watch, the city is far more cosmopolitan and includes
                peoples of nearly every race and culture known in
                this corner of the world. Dwarves are still the dominate
                group, but humans and halflings make up a
                close second, followed by dragonborn, tieflings, and a
                smattering of eladrin and elves, and an assortment of
                other, less familiar, races.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overlook is largely a trading center, and people
                on both sides of the mountain come to the city to
                exchange goods, rumors, and information. The city's
                numerous markets and bustling streets makes it the
                ideal place to do business, thus characters in search
                of a particular tool or device are more likely to find it
                here than anywhere for miles around.
            </p>
            <p>
                Supplementing its trade is a robust mining industry.
                The mountains are rich in iron, silver, tin, and no
                few gemstones. Dwarf and human miners and prospectors
                set out from Overlook each day, some working
                in the blackness of the deep mines, while others scour
                the heights in search of treasures-some succeeding,
                others failing, and others still vanishing in the misty
                peaks never to be seen again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the city depends on Bordrin's Watch to
                endure most of the attacks from the west, the city is
                not without its own defenses. The dwarves erected
                steep walls to protect themselves, but as the city outgrew
                its original protections, the inhabitants raised
                more walls to encircle the growing population. So far,
                this has happened four times, giving the city four sets
                of walls, one inside of the other. The shantytown, the
                unofficial ninth district, grows beyond the eastern
                walls and it's just a matter of time before the Council
                decides to raise another wall and add those squatters
                to the rest of the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                Piercing each wall, on both the western side and
                the eastern side, is a large gate flanked by two square
                stone towers. Most times, the gates stand open, even
                in the dead of night, but when trouble looms, such
                as now, the gates are closed at dusk, and the inner
                gates-the ones leading into High Hall - might close
                even earlier.

                The outer walls are 100 feet tall, taller where they travel over higher elevation.
                Each inner wall stands another 20 feet tall. Guards patrol the walls infrequently,
                though the gatehouses are held by a half-dozen warriors.

                <h3>Overlook Districts</h3>
                <p>Overlook has eight districts, each distinguished by the types of its people there as well as the industry one finds there.</p>
                <section id="Blister">
                    <h4>Blister</h4>
                    <blockquote>"Looking for work? You ought to prick the blister an' see what bubbles up . . ."</blockquote>
                    <p>The Blister is a rough-and-tumble section of the city, populated by mercenaries, adventurers, and the usual sort of traveling folk with few roots. Characterized by a great number of winesinks, taverns, pleasure dens, gambling halls, and bordellos, Blister is not a place to get lost.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                    Blister's buildings are a mix of timber and stone of architectural styles ranging the gamut. Old dwarven buildings stand next to almost organic tiefling dreaming halls, while a halfling gambling den sits in the shadow of an old temple dedicated to Sehanine in her more larcenous aspect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Streets:</h5>
                    Blister's roads thread their way through the press of buildings, darkened by shadows cast by structures built too close together. Filth and detritus clog the alleys, sometimes spilling out onto the major thoroughfares-that is, roads large enough to accommodate a horse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>People:</h5>
                    Humans, halflings, and dragonborn have the largest numbers in Blister, though one can find a variety of races here. As mentioned, most are adventurers, thieves, and traveling folk, representing the city's most diverse population.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Sights:</h5>
                    Visitors and inhabitants alike might see a pair of human thugs beating a half-orc with their clubs in an alley, a scantily clad man calling out to passersby, a street magician performing tricks, an elderly alchemist selling cure-alls, street preachers prophesizing the end of the world, tents and stalls, clotheslines stretched across the streets, and bands of adventurers looking for trouble.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Smells:</h5>
                    All sorts of odors waft up from Blister, including smells of exotic cuisine to the expected stench of a crowded district. Wood smoke hangs over the streets, mixing with other, more sinister smells.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Sounds:</h5>
                    Merchants hawk their wares amid laughter, screams, the murmur of crowds, the clatter of kitchens, cries of "thief!," the whistle of a constable in pursuit, the sounds of barking dogs, the hiss of cats, and the growls of spiretop drakes.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Boneyard</h4>
                    <blockquote>"Not much to do in the Boneyard aside from sicking up."</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Occupying the southeast corner of Overlook, Boneyard has every distasteful business and venture, including everything from the city's slaughterhouses, renderers, tanners, dyers, and even the city's graveyards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        As an industrial corner of the city, most buildings are plain and functional, and they are constructed to serve the operation and little else.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        The Boneyard features broad roads in good repair so wagons can easily navigate the district.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        Humans are the largest group of people here and most are dirty, lacking in sophistication, and inured to the foul odors wafting up from the more toxic parts of the district.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Sights:</h5>
                        Common sights include wagons laden with animal carcasses, workers trudging to their jobs, plumes of acrid smoke, and pipes leaking toxic fluids into the gutters. The Boneyard is as unpleasant to look at as it is to smell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Smells:</h5>
                        A pall of smoke stinking of urine and sulfur hangs over the Boneyard, turning the sun a pale shade of brown. Even though the locals do their best to keep the streets free of rubbish, the materials and industries produce ripe odors a shade better than death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Sounds:</h5>
                        One can hear the creaks of wagons, the spillage of liquids, crackling fire, the screams of animals at the slaughter, and the grunts of hard labor.

                <section id="Elftown">
                    <h4>Elftown</h4>
                    <blockquote>"Don't know why they still call it Elftown; can't say as I've ever seen an elf there."</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elftown covers the northwestern corner of the inner city and takes its name from the one elf to live there some seventy years ago. The community consists of upscale and well-off entrepreneurs, merchants, bankers, lawyers, physicians, and other members of Overlook's upper crust, and many folk elsewhere want to inhabit a small house on the edge of this fine quarter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        With fine buildings of astonishing architecture, white-washed or painted in pastel colors, Elftown has some of the nicest homes and shops in the city. Even the smaller houses are sumptuous compared to those of pretty much anywhere else in the city, and all are accented by parks, lawns of green grass, statuary, and beds of exotic flowers and semimobile plants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        Aside from the broad Dwarfroad that winds though Elftown, most streets are large enough to accommodate two carriages side by side. The roads are covered in pale white stone and maintained by a legion of well-paid servants. Even the side streets are clean and lit with everburning torches contained in iron lanterns to chase away the shadows.

                        In spite of the name, few, if any, elves live in Elftown, though several eladrin are affiliated with the ambassador who takes residence here. Instead, wealthy humans and dwarves command this section of the city, though one can be sure to find a handful of dragonborn, a smattering of tieflings, and a few reckless halflings.

                        The Forgeworks, or just the Forge, is a middle-class district given over to successful artisans, tradesfolk, and other men and women who work hard and are successful in their professions. More than half of the buildings here are workshops with apartments overhead. Warehouses, businesses, stables, and other places of industry round out the rest. The Forgeworks stands in the Middle City, south of Tradetown.

                        Broad streets, wide enough to accommodate aurochs and wagons, run through this district, while narrow alleys branch off to disappear in the maze of buildings beyond. Cobbles cover the ground and most are even to provide smooth transport to and from the Forge.
                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        Dwarves and humans live side by side in the Forgeworks, but one can also find a small population of half-elves, gnomes, and a few others as well. During the day, business here brings folk from all over the city to do business.

                    <h4>High Hall</h4>
                    <blockquote>"The heart and soul of Overlook, son, High Hall is where the movers and shakers make all the decisions."</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        High Hall, or the Old City, is where the city leaders convene to govern Overlook. Few folk still live in High Hall since nearly every inch of available space is given over to the various ministries making up the city's government. Thus, aside from a few extremely wealthy folks, most people funnel out of High Hall at the end of the day to head home to Elftown, Stonehammer, or elsewhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        High Hall consists of a forest of massive buildings packed tightly inside its walls. Towers thrust up from the fortresslike structures, climbing high above the walls and affording a look at the entire city and the lands all around. Most buildings house one of the dozen or so ministries that see to keeping the city operating. Examples include the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of War, and so on. Each operates out of a marble or brick building fronted by impressive statues of dwarf warriors, artisans, and historical figures, while the walls themselves bear intricate carvings and bas-reliefs capturing key moments from the city's history. The outer edge of High Hall holds the businesses and few homes of those who grease the engines of politics. Restaurants, inns, and a few shops provide patronage to the city's elite, but they shut down at nightfall.

                    <p>
                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        Suffering from too many buildings in a confined space, High Hall's roads are positively perilous. Tight and cramped while winding through the heart of Overlook, they contain numerous shadowy alcoves, dead-ends, and limited range of sight as they turn and twist. Although High Hall doesn't have a thievery problem, it does suffer from hired killers. The dwarves deal honorably with one another, but the same cannot be said for all the city's representatives, and rival humans, tieflings, and others might resort to murder to eliminate an inflexible politician. Thus, most high-ranking officials surround themselves with guards, making travel anywhere in High Hall all the harder.

                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        The Council of Elders might all be dwarves, but the rest of the city's government is as diverse as the city. Bureaucrats, functionaries, messengers, and palanquins bearing representatives from other districts all make their way through High Hall throughout the day, and sometimes at night.

                        <h5>Sights:</h5>
                        Buildings, buildings, and more buildings crowd the district, their carved faades telling ancient stories of heroic dwarves, the end of the Age of Chains, and other historical events that helped shape this region. One might see workers cleaning up a murder scene, while street vendors sell everything from amulets that promise to bring good luck in the courts, to food dealers, and tattered street lawyers searching for clients.

                    <p>
                        <h5>Smells:</h5>
                        Overcrowding and the malaise of too many people gives High Hall an unpleasant aroma in spite of the fact that the Council spares no expense in keeping this part of the city clean. Wafting up from the streets is a mix of rubbish, food, and sweat, but compared to other sections of Overlook, High Hall is tolerable.
                    </p>

                        <h5>Sounds:</h5>
                        Throughout the day, a steady hum of conversation sounds, punctuated with the ringing of bells, the angry shouts of guards as they escort their worthy charges through the press of people, voices raised in protest at some new law, and an assortment of other noises make High Hall loud. At night, however, it becomes deathly quiet.

                    <h4>Nine Bells</h4>
                    <blockquote>"Nine Bells, Nine Hells, all the same to me."</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Nine Bells district takes its name for the nine temples found in the heart of the district. Since these temples cater to the sick and the poor, this district draws the hungry, the diseased, and the destitute to its streets. Before the walls were raised here, Nine Bells was a place of great wealth-a community favored by those rich citizens who wanted to escape the clamor of the city. However, after it was annexed along with Blister and the Boneyard, the estates were abandoned and the folks fled to Stonehammer or Elftown to escape the flood of destitute people that washed into the place. Now, Nine Bells is the worst part of the city and is ever a source of embarrassment for the city's elite.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        With rotting estates, old vineyards now overrun by tents and wooden shacks, sagging rowhouses, and communities of tents, Nine Bells decays even while the rest of the city grows strong. The businesses, such as they are,
                        cater to darker interests, including dreaming halls, sinister taverns, fighting pits, and disease-ridden brothels. Huddled in one corner of this district are nine great temples, raised long ago, but faced, on all sides, by poverty, despair, and the worst sorts of people imaginable. Called the Divine Knot, a few of these temples have been abandoned, while the rest keep small staffs of dedicated servants who soldier on to fight the misery plaguing this district.

                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        As one might expect, Nine Bells' streets are muddy lanes and narrow alleys, all filthy and most worming through the press of decaying buildings. Closest to the temples, the muddy roads gain cobbles, typically clean and free of debris.

                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        Nine Bells is the bottom of the barrel, so to speak, and it welcomes anyone who has nowhere else to go. Humans, dwarves, tieflings, halflings, gnomes, and even a few half-orcs scratch out an existence in this wretched mire. Despair is strong here and it drives many
                        of its people to commit unspeakable acts to survive. Drugs, prostitution, and even slavery can all be found here.

People here are unclean and their odors mingle with that of the befouled air to create a symphony of noxious odors. Nearest to the temples, the air grows a bit more tolerable thanks to incense and the modicum of respect the people show the men and women of the cloth.

                        Stonehammer occupies the southern half of the inner city, and it wraps around High Hall up to the Dwarfroad. Like Elftown, Stonehammer is home to the wealthy citizens of Overlook, specifically the dwarves. Since this district is cleaner, safer, and more exclusive than other parts of the city, great deal of resentment exists toward the folks of Stonehammer from those of lower means and status.

                        Stonehammer is the most dwarven of districts, and its buildings are grand, sweeping, and magnificent to behold. Towers that thrust up from lower levels rival those found in High Hall in terms of height and grandeur. Since space is at a premium, the dwarves here have built upward. The wealthiest citizens live in the aeries, while servants, low-born dwarves, and all those who support the sumptuous lifestyles of the
                        elite dwell in the 'Dark-the bowels of Stonehammer.

                        Tradetown is a melting pot of all races, cultures, and occupations. In many ways, Tradetown is a lot like the Blister, but it has been established for longer and it has a mix of fabulous wealth and appalling poverty. Tradetown, as one might expect, is a commercial and retail district, where merchants, tradesfolk, and prospectors come to do business. Most middle-tier business-inclined people have homes here and gather in coffee
                        houses, upscale bars, and bathhouses to do business. In stark contrast to the bustling commerce, Tradetown is also home to a powerful thieving guild named the Lost Ones. A clandestine organization, they have agreements with nearly all the major enterprises here, offering protection (or rather exemption) from thievery and the promise to leave their customers alone.

                        Tradetown is every bit as cramped as the Blister and in some ways more so for the vendors and hawkers crowding the streets. Moving merchandise into Tradetown is a chore and often requires porters rather than wagons to transport anything of size. The roads are cobbled, but alleys and side-streets might be muddy and covered in rubbish.

Shady men and women walk the streets, eyes in constant motion as they search for new marks, while grifters and charlatans peddle cure-alls or use trickery to part their customers from their coin. Urchins run through the alleys, leading visitors through the safer parts of Tradetown, while disguised halflings lead other visitors to the nastier corners, where the travelers can find beatings and robberies instead of their destinations.

Shantytown is a wretched maze of tents, shacks, and rotting wooden buildings, and it is home to the poorest and most desperate of people that have nowhere else to go. Most of Shantytown's people are refugees from other lands, victims of tragedy and circumstance, or exiles who keep a low profile so they can go about their wicked business without attracting attention.

                        Tents and lean-tos make up the majority of "buildings" in Shantytown, though some wooden structures rise up from the mess like islands in a sea of misery.

                    <p>
                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        Little better than muddy paths wending through heaps of debris and filth, no one is sure if the mud is actually mud. . . .

                    <p>
                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        People of all races and from all lands live here, though humans appear to be the most numerous. Most have hard luck stories, but a few live here by choice-for easy hunting or to escape notice.

                        <h5>Sights:</h5>
                        One can see a filthy child screaming in the middle of a street, a flock of chickens fleeing from a hungry cat, a brown-clad cultist with a rat skull on a thong around his neck, a shrine dedicated to a sinister god, and a bloated corpse ripening in the sun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Smells:</h5>
                        Filth, filth, and more filth-the stench of Shantytown is staggering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Sounds:</h5>
                        Within this area one can hear laughter and crying, moans and sighs, the squelch of footfalls, the grunt
                        of pain, the short shriek of butchered animal, the howl of a dog in pain.

            <h3>Brindol Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Brindol has a smaller population than it
                did before the events of the original Red Hand of Doom. But the last
                decade has brought mild prosperity to the region,
                with only bandits (such as Sinruth and his ilk) disturbing
                the peace.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h5>Population:</h5>
                6,700; another 1,000 live within
                a five-mile radius of the town itself. The people of
                Brindol are mostly humans, half-elves, and dwarves.
                The town's population swells by several hundred
                whenever some connected halfling clans known as
                "the river people" are in town.
            </div>
            <p>
                <h5>Government:</h5>
                A town has a council, two-thirds
                of whom are hereditary landlords and the remainder
                of whom are guildmasters from the city's
                important trade guilds. Lord Warden Harrik Orenna
                is the public face of the council and commander of
                the city militia.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5 class="fullpage">Defense:</h5>
                The city has 200 soldiers under arms
                at all times, with about one-quarter on duty at any
                given time. In times of crisis, the Lord Warden has
                access to another 200 well-equipped but poorly
                trained soldiers by calling up the militia.

                Sayre is an artistic, monument-filled city built in a particularly
                beautiful valley. Sayre holds a university and
                a large number of artisans, making it a popular site for
                those who deal in either information or fine art.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h5>Population:</h5>
                Approximately 12,000, including
                almost 1,500 students attending the University. Most
                inhabitants are human, elf, eladrin, or halfling. Some
                dwarves also live in Sayre, although they tend to keep
                to themselves.
            </div>
            <div class="fullpage">
                <h5>Government:</h5>
                Sayre is governed by Lord Divian
                Torrance, a politically astute nobleman adept at playing
                different factions of the city against each other.
                Power resides with Lord Torrance, as well as the Artisan's
                Guild and the University's archdean.

            <div class="fullpage">
                <h5>Defense:</h5>
                The Guards of the March are a force of
                100 soldiers led by General Alvro Taramin that have
                little to do other than patrol the safer sections in and
                around the city. Most merchants, guilds, and noble
                families have their own mercenary guards that protect
                their property and work together when danger
                appears. In a time of crisis, General Taramin has the
                authority to call on any house with its own private
                guard to cede command of their troops directly to
                him. Fortunately, he has never had to do so, but if he
                were, he could call over 2,000 troops. With a cliff, a
                lake, and steep hills protecting three sides of Sayre, the
                Guards of the March spend much of their time outside
                the city patrolling the farming areas to the west.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Sayre is built in a small, defensible valley. Steep hills
                to the north provide protection from overland armies
                and make excellent spots for small defensive guard
                posts. The Lake of Songs sits uphill to the northwest of
                the city. Dammed at its outflow to help control floods,
                this lake is used year-round for fishing and recreation;
                it is extraordinarily beautiful and the subject of many
                paintings and tapestries by local artists. The Singing
                River descends from the lake and splits briefly into
                three branches as it flows through Sayre. A tall cliff
                guards Sayre's eastern flank, dropping 200 feet to the
                valley below. The only direction an invading army
                could easily approach Sayre from is the west, across
                the farms and fields, and guard towers alert the town
                to any threat approaching from that direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before Sayre was built, the city of Auger stood on this
                site, built over 400 years ago as a refuge for exiled diviners.
                A diviner named Auglos and his apprentices were
                driven from the island of Nefelus after he prophesized
                a local noble's death and was blamed by the man's relatives.
                After fleeing the family's wrath, Auglos settled
                in this particularly beautiful and defensible valley to
                continue his research into divination and communication.
                More academics and sages slowly joined him, and a
                small city - Auger - grew up around his tower.
            </p>
            <!--
            <p>
                Auglos's skill as a craftsman began to bring him
                fame. At first he specialized in divinatory devices
                such as crystal balls. His masterpiece was a huge glass
                globe the color of the evening sky, a device that could
                transmit messages thousands of miles and even across
                planes if individually crafted receiving mirrors were
                first attuned to it. Auglos sold the communication
                mirrors for extremely high prices, typically to merchant
                consortiums or the rulers of more prosperous
                city states. His customers never knew that if he chose,
                he could hear and see everything that passed through
                one of his glass devices, and that he also sold much of
                the information he obtained through his eavesdropping,
                resulting in an even more profitable secondary
                business in the espionage trade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Auglos knew that his glass globe created psychic
                ripples in the Astral Sea when it was used, but he
                didn't consider it a problem; how likely was it that
                anyone would be bothered? He should have done
                more research. His master glass, the device attuned to
                all the others that allowed him to listen in on so many
                fascinating conversations, created ripples near the
                githyanki city of Tu'narath, and psychic debris from
                the glass's communication soon caught the githyanki's
                attention. The githyanki quickly determined that
                someone on the mortal realm was using the energy of
                the plane to fuel a communication device. Paranoid
                in the extreme, within three months, the Lich Queen
                Vlaakith herself named this device the Bitter Glass
                and decreed that the psychic pollution must be eliminated.
                Her knights quickly carried out her orders.
            </p>
            <p>
                The raid on Auger was terrible to behold. Githyanki
                dragonriders shattered the town's dam, flooding the
                streets with water and mud, then proceeded to pick
                off fleeing citizens one by one. By the end of the night,
                Auglos and his assistants were dead, and the Bitter
                Glass was shattered and buried under the broken
                tower that housed it. Auger's remains were looted and
                abandoned, and survivors from the raid left the area,
                never aware of the reason behind the attack.

            <h3>Rebuilding</h3>
            <p>
                Shepherds moved back onto the site within sixty years,
                but without a dam on the Singing River, the site of
                the former city had become a flood plain whenever it
                rained. Finally, dwarven engineers rebuilt the dam on
                the Lake of Songs, and Sayre was built where Auger
                once stood. The level of the land had risen after so
                many years of floods, and none of the old buildings
                were still visible above ground. All residents of the
                modern city know that there is an old city beneath the
                streets, and some families dug down to take advantage
                of a pre-made cellar by digging through the roofs of
                old buildings, but enough people caused cave-ins or
                unleashed monsters that it's now illegal to dig into the
                undercity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sayre is ruled by a wily half-elven politician
                named Lord Divian Torrance, and under his direction
                the city goes out of its way to attract the finest artists
                and craftsmen in the land. As a result, many wealthy
                families call Sayre home, and all of these have their
                own mercenary security forces to protect their
                houses and workshops. Not much of a public militia
                is needed, although a small force controlled by Torrance's
                good friend General Taramin remains active.
                The public militia is subsidized by a public ordinance
                crafted by the wily Lord Torrance. Each family above
                a certain income level must commit a number of
                troops from their own personal guard units to the
                city's defense. This makes the city's safety the concern
                of all the wealthiest families, although it requires a
                charismatic and skillful general to keep all the different
                house troops in line. Sayre boasts a small theater
                and a large university that attracts scholars from cities
                across this corner of the mortal realm. For such a
                small city, Sayre is a shining beacon of light. Lord Torrance
                fully intends to keep it that way.

                <p>
                    Located at the northern tip of the city, this low-lying
                    area is prone to floods during the spring rains. Fishermen
                    and fishmongers who live here ply the lake for
                    their trade and live in raised huts. It's possible to buy
                    fish in the market district, but the freshest fish can
                    be bought by those brave enough to come north up
                    muddy streets and buy the catch coming off the boats.
                    There isn't much crime in the Fisher District; most
                    fishermen have large families, and they police their
                    own neighborhood with stout clubs and many friends.
                    Interestingly, this is the one neighborhood that isn't
                    defined by the breaks of the river. Fishermen live on
                    both outer shores and both inner ones, crossing the
                    rivers in small boats or over swaying rope bridges.

                    <strong>Ketch's Catch:</strong> This small fish stand has a reputation
                    for bringing in some of the largest, tastiest
                    fish in the lake. More importantly, the stall is run by
                    Gloriana Ketch. She makes a business of tracking city
                    gossip while her husband is off fishing, and she's a
                    good source for anyone who wants to know the latest
                    city rumors about the nobles or anyone of importance.

                <p>
                    This residential neighborhood holds the majority of
                    the city's grand estates and mansions. Flanked by
                    rivers on either side, the low hill rises gradually over
                    the rest of Sayre. This neighborhood was the heart
                    of the ancient City of Seers. All the richest citizens
                    of Sayre live here. There is virtually no crime here,
                    and private mercenary units ensure that the neighborhood
                    stays safe. Unsavory types moving through
                    Prospect Hill should expect to be challenged several
                    times, especially after dark.

                    <strong>The Pillar of Hope Reborn:</strong>
                    This ostentatious
                    memorial is a 60-foot-tall pillar with an eternal, magical
                    flame atop it. According to the plaque this marks
                    the spot of "Auglos the Wise's tower in Auger, first
                    founder of the city that became Sayre." It's not particularly
                    accurate, being located almost 200 feet from
                    Telicanthus's mansion and the actual site of the tower,
                    but it's a good meeting spot for young couples on
                    Prospect Hill who wish to go courting after dark. The
                    beggars of Sayre have a yearly competition, awarding
                    50 gp to anyone of their ilk who can surreptitiously
                    climb the pillar and extinguish the flame. Guardsmen
                    usually find crippled and dead beggars under
                    the pillar for weeks afterward.

                    boasting lanterns made from exquisitely blown glass,
                    this mansion was bought by Telicanthus and renovated
                    after the former owner moved south. It's one of
                    the social epicenters of Prospect Hill, and servants
                    and guests enter and exit it during most daylight
                    hours (or later, if Telicanthus is hosting a party.) A
                    competent and wily butler (Telicanthus's <span class="hidden">sociopathic</span>
                    servant Pennel) monitors all guests and stops anyone
                    who doesn't belong. Telicanthus's guards are notably
                    polite as they escort interlopers off the property. <span class="hidden">

                    This neighborhood on the eastern edge of Prospect
                    Hill is home to the city's artists. Sayre attracts many
                    of the finest craftsmen to this area. The wide roads
                    are lined with shops and stores, and are roughly
                    grouped by type of business. Businesses selling expensive
                    goods, such as goldmakers and jewelers, typically
                    have their own security. There's an atmosphere of
                    camaraderie in the Glassworks, and in the event of
                    trouble, all locals pitch in to solve the problem. Many
                    artists and shop owners live in apartments located
                    over their stores.

                    This is one of the finest inns
                    in the entire city, with superb service and prices to
                    match. Rooms are large, secure, beautifully decorated,
                    and extremely comfortable. The staff offers
                    any amenity a guest might want, and will send out
                    for food or items not offered in-house, and the chefs
                    are renowned for truly delicious meals. Rooms here
                    cost 15 gp a night, an outrageous amount compared
                    to other inns in the city, but rooms seldom go empty.

                    is as knowledgeable a dwarven craftsman
                    as you can find, and can usually identify a stained
                    glass window's craftsman if the individual is famous
                    enough. He charges high prices for high quality art, but

                    <strong>The University of Sayre:</strong>
                    Founded by a priestess of Ioun who was appalled with
                    the lack of learning among most people she met, the
                    university is a bustling school of higher learning that
                    teaches everything from agriculture to esoteric magical
                    theory. Students tend to be young and from out of
                    town, as the university recruits the best and brightest
                    from many different areas. The university is often
                    viewed as an excellent finishing school for noble sons
                    and daughters, and it isn't uncommon for loyal servants
                    to be seen dragging their drunken masters back
                    home after a rowdy night in the Dregs.

                    This is a popular tavern
                    for students who want to be in stumbling distance of
                    their rooms after drinking, and for those who don't
                    care for the Dregs. Many professors from the university
                    have adopted the tankard as their own, as well.
                    This is the place to come if you want a philosophical
                    debate instead of a fistfight.

                <p>
                    While most races have integrated nicely in Sayre,
                    the dwarven inhabitants tend to keep to themselves.
                    Low Mountain is a neighborhood of high stone walls
                    and twisting streets. Non-dwarves have trouble finding
                    places in Low Mountain, as none of the streets
                    are labeled, and none of the buildings are numbered
                    or named. As they say, "If you need to know where
                    you are in Low Mountain, you probably shouldn't be
                    there."
                    The area is safe, with squads formed exclusively
                    of dwarven guards patrolling the streets after
                    nightfall, but it's not particularly exciting to nondwarves.
                    That changes if you're a dwarf, or have the
                    trust of one. Wonderful restaurants, clever sages,
                    and master craftsmen hide within the featureless
                    buildings. Some dwarves will accept a bribe to guide
                    outsiders to the right place and introduce them to the
                    right contact.

                    sages who specialize in maps and locations. Commonly
                    consulted by explorers into the Underdark and
                    merchants who have long journeys ahead of them,
                    the Scrollstone brothers are the people to consult if
                    one wishes to learn more about Sayre's undercity.
                    They have old maps showing what
                    buildings used to be where.

                    This is the heart of the city for everyone but the
                    wealthiest citizens. The streets are full of people
                    from all walks of life, and any non-exotic object (as
                    well as many exotic and rare ones) can be purchased
                    here. Whether you're looking for ink from a giant
                    octopus or the feather from an angel, you're likely to
                    be able to buy it - or something that the seller swears
                    is authentic - somewhere in the market. This area is
                    characterized by narrow streets, tiny shop stalls, yelling
                    shopkeeps, and a multitude of different bazaars.
                    Due to the university, the market contains a great
                    number of booksellers and scrollmakers. Debt-ridden
                    sages who have been forced to sell their library
                    crouch side by side with itinerant thieves peddling

                    regulars in the market who consider it good luck to
                    throw her a few coins when they pass by. In return,
                    she is unfailingly friendly to anyone who doesn't treat
                    her with contempt. Agnes is always happy to pass a
                    few minutes chatting with strangers, and she's the
                    best resource for finding something quickly, as she
                    has a good memory for what merchant has what sort
                    of item.

                <p>
                    The March looks almost like a military parade ground.
                    This area was once the preferred spot for Lord Limbic
                    the Scholar, a former ruler who had an obsession with
                    statuary and monuments. As a result, he spent a great
                    deal of the city's coffers on self-aggrandizing monuments.
                    More than two dozen great statues, triumphal
                    arches to non-existent battles, and other spectacular
                    monuments stand in this area. They're starting to
                    decay somewhat due to a lack of interest in keeping
                    them pristine, but they define this section of the city.

                    <strong>The Dangle:</strong>
                    This was originally named "The
                    Triumphal Arch of Limbic the Gracious" until it was
                    turned into the city's location for public execution and
                    punishment. Murderers are hanged from the 30-foot-tall
                    arch and left to dangle for a few days. Public
                    stocks are also located here, for punishments of a less
                    severe nature. Public executions are rare in Sayre,
                    and the city hasn't seen one in months.

                    Sayre doesn't require a
                    large standing army thanks to the proliferation of
                    private guards, but the one hundred full-time city
                    militia the city employs are stationed in this gray, austere
                    building that is also known for its statue of Lord
                    Limbic standing on the roof.

                    Most of the city's entertainment is located in this

                    dangerous to visitors, as thugs paid by local businesses
                    roam the streets with the intent of keeping people
                    safe in the theory that "a live customer is a paying
                    customer." They've been known to look the other way

                    Dark and smoke-stained buildings house beggars
                    with wet coughs from the constant moisture. Rats
                    scuttling through glassless windows provide one of
                    the few free food sources for the locals. It isn't an
                    attractive place to live, and visitors who show weakness
                    are likely to be preyed upon by the locals.

                    <strong>The Plaza of Vision:</strong>
                    This abandoned plaza is surrounded
                    by vacant buildings. The githzerai living in
                    Sayre have taken over one of them, reinforcing it and
                    using it as a temporary headquarters.

                    <strong>Lowbridge:</strong>
                    The local temple to Tiamat, worshipped
                    in her role as Goddess of Greed and Envy, is located in
                    an abandoned warehouse across the street from the last
                    bridge in Sayre. Beggars congregate in this area each
                    morning before heading out across the city. The beggars,
                    strangely, won't speak to anyone while near Lowbridge.
                    They won't ask for money until they've gone to other parts
                    of town, as they're careful not to draw attention to the
                    activities of the Filth King (leader of the city's beggars).
