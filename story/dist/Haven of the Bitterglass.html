            Son of the late satyr demigod Papposilenus and a druid upholding his father's ideals, Barases searches for his brother Petraynus - heir to his father's godhead.
            His father's domain has grown increasingly strained and twisted after his passing, rot settling into the heart of the wood. Dutiful and loyal, Barases has ventured
            far from the comfort of the Feywild in search of the prodigal son in hopes of restoring balance.

            the evil forces working against Elsir Vale. While infiltrating the Wicked Fang tribe she was captured and subjected to
            Fangren's corrupt rituals manipulating enemies from the Elemental Chaos. Rescued before being sacrificed, Bin now continues

            propriety of her Dragonborn culture - even her gender (she is physically male). Blessed (or cursed) with her father's wanderlust
            she left home to train as a bard where her flamboyant rebellion, cross-dressing fashion sense, and acerbic wit found an
            appreciative audience. She has a talent for appealing to the rebels in restrictive cultures and has plied it with success among
            the dwarves of Elsir Vale. She searches for a way to truly break free of her bonds and fully realize her feminine self.

            the general aloofness of the elves made her father distant, and in reaction to that pain she rejected the calming influence of her father's nature and
            gave into the evil pull of her infernal heritage - resorting to alcohol, drugs, and eventually crime. Her vices have spiraled on multiple occasions,

            Drafted into the Fomori legion, she was raised to be an elite warrior and an arcane assassin. At puberty she was taken by the coven of Howling Hags in service
            to Cachlain and multilated in perverse Fomori rituals - they took her eye and part of her soul but grafted a new eye and part of new soul in its place. The
            ritual twisted her, but also granted her greater powers. Feeling betrayed by this violation Kitara fled Cachlain's service and ended up working as a mercenary
            under Sarshan before leaving his service as well in disgust. Now she acts against her former masters in a mission of revenge.

            help guard the borders against the orc hordes to the south. When Thrand travelled to Elsir Vale as a member of the Dawn Wardens Lechonero made
            frequent visits to his mentor. Taking advantage of his frequent trips along the Dawn Way, Lechonero's clan elder Caliandra used him as a trading
            envoy to the eastern city of Dornaithos, the first trading post of Astrazalian fully in the world. When Thrand returned to the Stagrunners he
            charged Lechonero with looking after his daughters Kallista and Karrion. Recently in Dornaithos, Lechonero had an affair with
            Brandowen ("Brandi") Entromiel - the master of that mercantile settlement and as aggressive a lover as she was a saleswoman. In a heated moment
            that ended their affair Lechonero inadvertently absconded with her bonded bear companion from the Feywild and he has been avoiding her ever since.

            Azarr Kul was a half-dragon hobgoblin warrior and a child of the blue dragon Tyrgarun.
            Azarr Kul discovered the Thane of Tiamat (an abandonned temple deep in the Wyrmsmoke Mountains) and converted from worshipping
            Maglubiyet to Tiamat. He united the goblinoid tribes of the Wyrmsmoke Mountains and dubbed them the Kulkor Zhul and adopted the
            standard of the Red Hand (an ancient symbol of Tiamat's cult). Conquering the Wyrmsmoke Mountains he named his kingdom Harg
            Kulkor - "Land of the Dragon." Crowning himself High Wyrmlord he marched his army to conquer an unsuspecting Elsir Vale. The
            adventuring party the Dawn Wardens encountered the army early by happenstance and stymied its advance by collapsing the ancient
            dwarven bridge at Skull Gorge. In the interim they rallied the people of the vale to defend against the Red Hand and ultimately
            assassinated Azarr Kul. Without his leadership his fractuous army split and turned on itself, leading to its defeat by the
            peoples of the Vale.

            Caliandra of the Stagrunners was an ancient elf
            who could trace her descendants back to elves who migrated
            from the Feywild almost eleven of her generations
            ago. She lead not only her own tribe, the Stagrunners (of which Lechonero is a part),
            but had also been named the voice of all the
            tribes that live in the wild reaches to the north and
            west of Elsir Vale. All told, she spoke for a group of
            twenty-five tribes.
            Fierce, wild, and haughty, she was stubborn and
            opinionated, and wasn't afraid to engage in a protracted
            argument about aspects of history that most
            people had long forgotten. She held influence
            with many gnome, elf, and eladrin leaders, much
            as a respected grandmother and advisor might.
            She leaned toward solutions that provided the
            most safety for the most people. She seemed to expect
            subservience, making her nearly intolerable
            to deal with.
            One of the naysayers of the Gatekeepers, Caliandra
            automatically assumed her age and experience made
            her the voice everyone else should listen to. She talked
            loudly, fiercely, and often, but she didn't mince
            words. She got to her point quickly. She favored action
            of some sort, but was like a ship in need of a pilot. If
            given a course that she could approve of - something
            that will let her lead her people to glorious battle
            against the invaders who have killed so many of her
            people - she would fight honorably and without hesitation.
            But she demanded respect, and was fond of rejecting
            someone else's idea out of hand, only to bring it back
            up minutes later as a concept all her own.

            foremost, was to see that his city came out ahead in
            the war. He wasn't willing to side with the githyanki
            invaders, but his goal was to lead the alliance so that
            his small city was given due representation. He knew
            that Sayre's leadership wouldn't have been consulted
            if not for the good fortune of hosting the first meeting
            and the absence of a representative from Nefelus.

            Fangren was a demonic gnoll and chief of the Wicked Fang tribe who plagued the lands around
            the Giantshield Mountains. Receiving aid (in the form of weapons and advisors) from Sarshan,
            Fangren took up residence in the abandoned monastery, Fortress Graystone.
            He attempted to use the planar energies of the Elemental Chaos woven into the place by its
            githzerai creators to perform a ritual that would turn him into an exarc of the demon lord
            Yeenoghu. Our heroes killed Fangren's followers and shadar-kai allies before halting the
            Fangren's ritual sacrifice of Bin and instead channeled the ritual's energies into a ritual
            of their own that released Amyria from her sword. Melvin mysteriously disappeared while exploring
            Fortress Graystone, only to reappear months later fighting the githyanki. Among Sarshan's gifts
            to Fangren was the magical blade called Wicked Fang in honor of his tribe.

            Fariex the Scalehammer was a tall, richly dressed man with a burnished dark complexion.
            He was a powerful merchant with interests
            in various cities. Fariex did not represent a city
            or other political body, but was invited to the Gatekeepers because of his
            connections to many far-reaching settlements, townships,
            and ports, and the wealth and military might
            they represent.
            He was light-hearted by nature, and knew more jokes
            than most jesters. Far from a buffoon, however,
            he expected respect.
            He was slow to weigh the facts of a problem instead of quickly
            making up his mind.
            Generally quiet, Fariex would occasionally interject a pointed question,
            especially if the topic of conversation touched on his
            area of expertise (namely, money and its movement
            through business affairs). He openly tried to
            catch others in duplicity or engage in some word play
            over a statement he perceived as absurd.

            worn down by these encounters and his own traps before attacking, pretending to help them
            against other enemies if it looked like someone else might successfully collect the bounty.

            Inogo Dravitch was a dragonborn priest of Erathis. Inogo hailed
            from the distant city of Sherrbyr (Festivus' home). This city lies far
            to the northeast, beyond Elsir Vale by at least three
            weeks' travel. Inogo was the current leader of this city of
            temples. A theocratic city state, Sherrbyr also boasted
            a massive college of divinity, where worshipers of
            nearly any deity could openly practice their faith.
            As a result of its varied populace, the city's leadership
            was formed of a council of priests of the most
            worshiped deities in the city. The council changed as
            the population changed. Some deities fell out of favor
            while others rose. But Erathis's worshipers had been
            a power in the city for years, and Inogo was the most
            recent in a long series of Erathis-worshiping council
            leaders known as Deacons.
            Sherrbyr was a city accustomed to nearly endless
            debate, thanks to efforts to accommodate every faith
            represented on the ruling council. As someone long
            schooled in this approach to government, Deacon
            Dravitch was well out of his league in a group that needs
            to make decisions quickly and decisively. He represented
            a powerful city, however, in terms of both its
            military and divine might. Sherrbyr could field a veritable
            army of healers, as well as a mounted corps of
            paladins. Inogo was mostly quiet in the meetings,
            speaking up only when a plan of action is proposed.

        <span class="description">
            Sinruth was a hobgoblin with greater aspirations than
            a life spent preying on the fringes of civilization. He
            listened closely at the campfires when his fathers
            and uncles told tales of the Red Hand of Doom, a
            mighty army that ran across the land like a scythe.
            And when he became an adult and a leader of his
            own band of hobgoblins, he found a cache of tunics
            and weapons left behind by that army. Sinruth felt
            his destiny calling. He declared himself the new
            Warlord of Sinruth's Hand (as he named the group),
            emblazoned every possible surface with a crudely
            painted, downward thrusting red hand insignia, and
            set about recruiting the massive army that he felt was
            his birthright.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But starting an army wasn't as easy as those campfire
            tales led Sinruth to believe. Years passed with
            Sinruth's band eking out a meager existence in the
            wilderness. But slowly, he started to gain allies. A
            temporary bargain with some sinister, mischievous
            gnomes blossomed into a lasting friendship. The Red
            Hand's exploration of the mountains unearthed some
            undisturbed catacombs beneath the long-ruined
            Castle Rivenroar. Sinruth struck another bargain,
            and the undead guardians let the Red Hand move
            in, in exchange for periodic payment of kidnapped
            prisoners.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sinruth and the reconstituted Red Hand had a
            base and a growing reputation, but they were far from
            a mighty army. An "Emissary" from another remnant of
            the Red Hand offered to join forces under Sinruth's
            banner and more than double Sinruth's fifty soldiers
            under arms. All Sinruth had to do was attack Brindol,
            steal some relics from the original Red Hand invasion,
            and take enough prisoners to keep the undead
            guardians of Rivenroar satisfied.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sinruth personally led the assault on Brindol, sacking
            Brindol's Hall of Great Valor, stealing back
            many of the museum pieces on display there. Sinruth
            brought back seven prisoners, despite the fact that the
            new Red Hand lost half its number in the attack.

            Sinruth died at the hands of the Dusk Wardens when they
            came to rescue the prisoners and retrieve the relics.

        <span class="description">
            Tusk was an orc leader is an overlarge warrior and chieftain. Not a true orc, he has the blood of
            ogres in his veins, which made him larger, tougher,
            and eminently more dangerous. Having slaughtered
            half a dozen orc chieftains, he drew together the
            unruly tribes to mount an offensive against Bordrin's
            Watch to lay claim to the soft lands beyond its walls.
            Tusk knew the history of the Stonehome Mountains
            well, knowing that unless he could find some way to
            bypass the fortress in the mountains, it wouldn't matter
            how many warriors he commanded since he would fail.
            What Tusk needed was a way around the fortress.
            Ever resourceful and with numerous contacts and
            allies, Tusk turned to his occasional lover and advisor,
            a shadar-kai witch named Myrissa. He sent her back
            to the Shadowfell to recruit allies to help his cause,
            and a short time later she returned with a small army
            of dark ones, led by a mysterious and sinister dark
            creeper, known as the Emissary (Modra). This leader offered
            to assist Tusk in exchange for an exclusive arrangement
            in which they would supply Tusk's armies with
            weaponry for whatever price Modra asked, and in exchange, the dark creepers
            would find a way through the mountains. Tusk readily
            agreed and paid the exorbitant price, gaining a
            fine arsenal, and also, he hoped, the key to victory.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Not long after, the dark creepers returned and
            revealed a number of tunnels burrowed beneath the
            mountain. They showed the chieftain the locations of
            each, explaining how the passages connected one side
            of the mountains to the other. No tunnel was large
            enough to accommodate his entire army, so, Tusk
            gave his horde their marching orders, sending them
            to climb the mountain slopes, while his scouts moved
            ahead to secure the tunnels and prepare the way for
            Tusk and his elite warriors to strike the fortress from
            below.

            <p>
                Once, he reigned supreme.
            </p>
            <p>
                General Zithiruun was a great hero - one of the
                most respected military leaders of a militant race.
                From the great city of Tu'narath, he led armies of the
                githyanki on raids across the Astral Sea, and into a
                dozen different regions and kingdoms of the mortal
                realm. From the deck of the astral galleon Siun'kara
                or the back of Rathoraiax, his great red dragon steed,
                Zithiruun proved an unstoppable force - a champion
                among a race of champions. Even Vlaakith, the
                fearsome githyanki lich queen, acknowledged his
                greatness, heaped great praise upon him.
                And then the great General Zithiruun took on a
                foe beyond even his own prowess.
            </p>
            <p>
                That it was a dragon, a dragon far greater than
                Rathoraiax, everyone knows, but tales of the confrontation
                differ as to whether it was a black wyrm,
                one of the fearsome scourge dragons, or something
                else entirely. But while not everyone knows precisely
                what it was Zithiruun faced, everyone knows what
                happened as a result.
            </p>
            <p>
                A hideous burst of something - acid, perhaps, or
                pure necrotic energy - ripped the life from the red
                dragon Rathoraiax, shredding flesh and obliterating
                entire portions of the beast. And it was this attack
                that felled Zithiruun as well. It stripped the strength
                from his limbs, rotted bits of flesh and even weakened
                bone. Any lesser warrior would have died in that hideous
                moment, but the general clung to life through
                sheer force of stubborn, malignant will.
            </p>
            <p>
                It took years for Zithiruun to retrain and reinvigorate
                his broken body. Even by the time he encountered our heroes, he was a shadow of
                what he once was - weaker in body, far less sound in
                mind. His own people had all but turned their backs
                on him; though his great achievements prevented them
                from executing or exiling him utterly, they scorn his
                weakness and hold him in contempt for allowing himself
                and his mount to be so soundly defeated. By the siege of Overlook,
                Zithiruun served as a lowly operative of Tu'narath's
                forces and he led only lesser warriors into battle
                while answering to and obeying githyanki who would
                once have feared even to speak in his presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zithiruun's native powers had mutated through
                his years of effort as he attempted to reinvigorate
                his body at the expense of his mental prowess. The
                ambition all githyanki share had been subsumed by
                a burning need to prove himself and to regain the
                position and the respect that were once his by right -
                even as he nursed a resentful hatred of the very people
                whose adulation he so desperately craved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zithiruun had been large for a githyanki, but since the
                destruction and atrophy of much of his musculature,
                he appeared almost impossibly tall and gaunt.
                Mixed with and attached to the traditional leathers of
                his people, he wore a contraption of braces and harnesses,
                constructed of leather straps and iron joints.
            </p>
            <p>
                These braces, supported at his shoulders and by a strap
                across his chest, ran the length of his left arm and left
                leg, as well as a portion of his right leg. It is the straps
                that gave those limbs rigidity; without them, they could
                scarcely move, and not support his weight. This harness
                also granted him full mobility; charged with both
                magic and psychic energy, it permited him motion and
                granted him strength he would otherwise lack.
            </p>
            <p>
                His flesh clung tightly to his skeleton and puckered
                away from old wounds, exposing muscle and even
                charred bone. His left cheek gaped open, revealing
                a bit of metal plate that replaced a fragment of skull.
                A leather strap held the left side of his jaw in place,
                replacing obliterated muscle.
            </p>
            <p>
                He appeared weak indeed, and in some ways he
                truly was. Yet Zithiruun wielded his great silver saber
                with an astonishing, impossible precision, and his
                eyes burned with loathing and ambition to shame even
                the other githyanki.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite his drive, General Zithiruun met his end at the
                hands of our heroes when he laid siege to Overlook with
                his mercenary army.

            <h3>Overlook Summary</h3>
            <p>
                This city of stone stands on the side of the Stonehome Mountains. Constructed as a haven for newly liberated dwarves from their former giant masters, Overlook has since outgrown its noble roots and become a haven for peoples all over the Elsir Vale and beyond.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h5>Population:</h5>
                12,250; about another 5,000 people live in small settlements scattered on the lower slopes. The people of Overlook are mostly dwarves, humans, and halflings, though pockets of dragonborn, tiefling, eladrin, and elf communities are isolated in their own ethnic neighborhoods. Overlook's importance as a trade center results in great numbers of travelers from faraway lands and of a wild assortment of races, cultures, and beliefs, lending the city its cosmopolitan atmosphere. Government: The Council of Elders, a group of five male and female dwarves, governs Overlook. Each is elected to office and serves a 10-year term. The dwarves see ruling as a burden and none relish the job, preferring to hand power off to someone else. Heading up the Council is the Great Elder, Morgoff Stonefirst, an aging dwarf who's ready to retire.
            </div>
            <p>
                One representative from each of the eight districts of Overlook attends the Council, serving as advisors and also to air the grievances of their particular constituencies. Although these individuals have the power to influence, they have no real authority in the city, though many are wealthy and powerful by means other than the office they hold.
            </p>
            <div class="fullpage">
                <h5>Defense:</h5>
                Overlook keeps a standing garrison of 150 warriors armed and ready for any threat. In times of trouble (such as now), Overlook can muster another 500 warriors from the local militia, and another 100 from the outlying settlements. At Bordrin's Watch, another 500 hundred warriors protect the mountain pass from within its steep walls and skyscraping towers.

                The city of Overlook stands on the eastern slopes of
                the Stonehome Mountains, a hoary range of crumbling
                peaks as old as the world. The city's founding
                lies sometime far back in the mists of time, at a point
                after the dwarves in this region threw off the shackles
                of slavery and chased the giants and orcs west across
                the mountains at the end of the Age of Chains. Overlook,
                and the fastness of Bordrin's Watch, were raised
                to safeguard the liberated dwarf peoples and to be
                the first line of defense should their ancient enemies
                forget their defeat and seek to enslave the dwarves
                once more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since its founding, Overlook has never come under
                attack, though Bordrin's Watch has time and again,
                at least once every century. Overlook supplies the
                mountain pass with soldiers, supplies, and needed
                resources, ensuring the Watch is never without the
                goods they need to live up to their ancient responsibility.
                While doughty dwarf warriors hold the
                Watch, the city is far more cosmopolitan and includes
                peoples of nearly every race and culture known in
                this corner of the world. Dwarves are still the dominate
                group, but humans and halflings make up a
                close second, followed by dragonborn, tieflings, and a
                smattering of eladrin and elves, and an assortment of
                other, less familiar, races.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overlook is largely a trading center, and people
                on both sides of the mountain come to the city to
                exchange goods, rumors, and information. The city's
                numerous markets and bustling streets makes it the
                ideal place to do business, thus characters in search
                of a particular tool or device are more likely to find it
                here than anywhere for miles around.
            </p>
            <p>
                Supplementing its trade is a robust mining industry.
                The mountains are rich in iron, silver, tin, and no
                few gemstones. Dwarf and human miners and prospectors
                set out from Overlook each day, some working
                in the blackness of the deep mines, while others scour
                the heights in search of treasures-some succeeding,
                others failing, and others still vanishing in the misty
                peaks never to be seen again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the city depends on Bordrin's Watch to
                endure most of the attacks from the west, the city is
                not without its own defenses. The dwarves erected
                steep walls to protect themselves, but as the city outgrew
                its original protections, the inhabitants raised
                more walls to encircle the growing population. So far,
                this has happened four times, giving the city four sets
                of walls, one inside of the other. The shantytown, the
                unofficial ninth district, grows beyond the eastern
                walls and it's just a matter of time before the Council
                decides to raise another wall and add those squatters
                to the rest of the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                Piercing each wall, on both the western side and
                the eastern side, is a large gate flanked by two square
                stone towers. Most times, the gates stand open, even
                in the dead of night, but when trouble looms, such
                as now, the gates are closed at dusk, and the inner
                gates-the ones leading into High Hall - might close
                even earlier.

                The outer walls are 100 feet tall, taller where they travel over higher elevation.
                Each inner wall stands another 20 feet tall. Guards patrol the walls infrequently,
                though the gatehouses are held by a half-dozen warriors.

                <h3>Overlook Districts</h3>
                <p>Overlook has eight districts, each distinguished by the types of its people there as well as the industry one finds there.</p>
                <section id="Blister">
                    <h4>Blister</h4>
                    <blockquote>"Looking for work? You ought to prick the blister an' see what bubbles up . . ."</blockquote>
                    <p>The Blister is a rough-and-tumble section of the city, populated by mercenaries, adventurers, and the usual sort of traveling folk with few roots. Characterized by a great number of winesinks, taverns, pleasure dens, gambling halls, and bordellos, Blister is not a place to get lost.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                    Blister's buildings are a mix of timber and stone of architectural styles ranging the gamut. Old dwarven buildings stand next to almost organic tiefling dreaming halls, while a halfling gambling den sits in the shadow of an old temple dedicated to Sehanine in her more larcenous aspect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Streets:</h5>
                    Blister's roads thread their way through the press of buildings, darkened by shadows cast by structures built too close together. Filth and detritus clog the alleys, sometimes spilling out onto the major thoroughfares-that is, roads large enough to accommodate a horse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>People:</h5>
                    Humans, halflings, and dragonborn have the largest numbers in Blister, though one can find a variety of races here. As mentioned, most are adventurers, thieves, and traveling folk, representing the city's most diverse population.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Sights:</h5>
                    Visitors and inhabitants alike might see a pair of human thugs beating a half-orc with their clubs in an alley, a scantily clad man calling out to passersby, a street magician performing tricks, an elderly alchemist selling cure-alls, street preachers prophesizing the end of the world, tents and stalls, clotheslines stretched across the streets, and bands of adventurers looking for trouble.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Smells:</h5>
                    All sorts of odors waft up from Blister, including smells of exotic cuisine to the expected stench of a crowded district. Wood smoke hangs over the streets, mixing with other, more sinister smells.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>Sounds:</h5>
                    Merchants hawk their wares amid laughter, screams, the murmur of crowds, the clatter of kitchens, cries of "thief!," the whistle of a constable in pursuit, the sounds of barking dogs, the hiss of cats, and the growls of spiretop drakes.

                    <h4>Boneyard</h4>
                    <blockquote>"Not much to do in the Boneyard aside from sicking up."</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Occupying the southeast corner of Overlook, Boneyard has every distasteful business and venture, including everything from the city's slaughterhouses, renderers, tanners, dyers, and even the city's graveyards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        As an industrial corner of the city, most buildings are plain and functional, and they are constructed to serve the operation and little else.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        The Boneyard features broad roads in good repair so wagons can easily navigate the district.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        Humans are the largest group of people here and most are dirty, lacking in sophistication, and inured to the foul odors wafting up from the more toxic parts of the district.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Sights:</h5>
                        Common sights include wagons laden with animal carcasses, workers trudging to their jobs, plumes of acrid smoke, and pipes leaking toxic fluids into the gutters. The Boneyard is as unpleasant to look at as it is to smell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Smells:</h5>
                        A pall of smoke stinking of urine and sulfur hangs over the Boneyard, turning the sun a pale shade of brown. Even though the locals do their best to keep the streets free of rubbish, the materials and industries produce ripe odors a shade better than death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Sounds:</h5>
                        One can hear the creaks of wagons, the spillage of liquids, crackling fire, the screams of animals at the slaughter, and the grunts of hard labor.

                    <h4>Elftown</h4>
                    <blockquote>"Don't know why they still call it Elftown; can't say as I've ever seen an elf there."</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elftown covers the northwestern corner of the inner city and takes its name from the one elf to live there some seventy years ago. The community consists of upscale and well-off entrepreneurs, merchants, bankers, lawyers, physicians, and other members of Overlook's upper crust, and many folk elsewhere want to inhabit a small house on the edge of this fine quarter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        With fine buildings of astonishing architecture, white-washed or painted in pastel colors, Elftown has some of the nicest homes and shops in the city. Even the smaller houses are sumptuous compared to those of pretty much anywhere else in the city, and all are accented by parks, lawns of green grass, statuary, and beds of exotic flowers and semimobile plants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        Aside from the broad Dwarfroad that winds though Elftown, most streets are large enough to accommodate two carriages side by side. The roads are covered in pale white stone and maintained by a legion of well-paid servants. Even the side streets are clean and lit with everburning torches contained in iron lanterns to chase away the shadows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        In spite of the name, few, if any, elves live in Elftown, though several eladrin are affiliated with the ambassador who takes residence here. Instead, wealthy humans and dwarves command this section of the city, though one can be sure to find a handful of dragonborn, a smattering of tieflings, and a few reckless halflings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Sights:</h5>
                        Observers can see black carriages pulled by teams of matching horses, patrols of uniformed guards, and fountains sending spray into the air, as well as servants painting houses, cleaning the streets, and avoiding attention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Smells:</h5>
                        One is likely to smell fine cooking, fresh-cut grass, the perfume of brilliant flowers, incense, and other pleasant aromas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Sounds:</h5>
                        Notes played on a harp, the singing of a lovely young woman (or a younger man), a haughty noble screaming at a servant, the whinny of horses, and the clink of gold are common sounds.

                    <p>
                        The Forgeworks, or just the Forge, is a middle-class district given over to successful artisans, tradesfolk, and other men and women who work hard and are successful in their professions. More than half of the buildings here are workshops with apartments overhead. Warehouses, businesses, stables, and other places of industry round out the rest. The Forgeworks stands in the Middle City, south of Tradetown.

                        Broad streets, wide enough to accommodate aurochs and wagons, run through this district, while narrow alleys branch off to disappear in the maze of buildings beyond. Cobbles cover the ground and most are even to provide smooth transport to and from the Forge.
                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        Dwarves and humans live side by side in the Forgeworks, but one can also find a small population of half-elves, gnomes, and a few others as well. During the day, business here brings folk from all over the city to do business.

                        The air is pregnant with the smells of sweat, smoke, and industry. Street vendors sell meat pies, sausages, and other portable foods for workers and visitors alike, lending the pleasant (or not so pleasant) aromas of their fare to the atmosphere. Although a busy part of Overlook, the Forgeworks is surprisingly clean.

                    <h4>High Hall</h4>
                    <blockquote>"The heart and soul of Overlook, son, High Hall is where the movers and shakers make all the decisions."</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        High Hall, or the Old City, is where the city leaders convene to govern Overlook. Few folk still live in High Hall since nearly every inch of available space is given over to the various ministries making up the city's government. Thus, aside from a few extremely wealthy folks, most people funnel out of High Hall at the end of the day to head home to Elftown, Stonehammer, or elsewhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        High Hall consists of a forest of massive buildings packed tightly inside its walls. Towers thrust up from the fortresslike structures, climbing high above the walls and affording a look at the entire city and the lands all around. Most buildings house one of the dozen or so ministries that see to keeping the city operating. Examples include the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of War, and so on. Each operates out of a marble or brick building fronted by impressive statues of dwarf warriors, artisans, and historical figures, while the walls themselves bear intricate carvings and bas-reliefs capturing key moments from the city's history. The outer edge of High Hall holds the businesses and few homes of those who grease the engines of politics. Restaurants, inns, and a few shops provide patronage to the city's elite, but they shut down at nightfall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        Suffering from too many buildings in a confined space, High Hall's roads are positively perilous. Tight and cramped while winding through the heart of Overlook, they contain numerous shadowy alcoves, dead-ends, and limited range of sight as they turn and twist. Although High Hall doesn't have a thievery problem, it does suffer from hired killers. The dwarves deal honorably with one another, but the same cannot be said for all the city's representatives, and rival humans, tieflings, and others might resort to murder to eliminate an inflexible politician. Thus, most high-ranking officials surround themselves with guards, making travel anywhere in High Hall all the harder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        The Council of Elders might all be dwarves, but the rest of the city's government is as diverse as the city. Bureaucrats, functionaries, messengers, and palanquins bearing representatives from other districts all make their way through High Hall throughout the day, and sometimes at night.
                    </p>

                        <h5>Sights:</h5>
                        Buildings, buildings, and more buildings crowd the district, their carved faades telling ancient stories of heroic dwarves, the end of the Age of Chains, and other historical events that helped shape this region. One might see workers cleaning up a murder scene, while street vendors sell everything from amulets that promise to bring good luck in the courts, to food dealers, and tattered street lawyers searching for clients.

                        Overcrowding and the malaise of too many people gives High Hall an unpleasant aroma in spite of the fact that the Council spares no expense in keeping this part of the city clean. Wafting up from the streets is a mix of rubbish, food, and sweat, but compared to other sections of Overlook, High Hall is tolerable.

                        Throughout the day, a steady hum of conversation sounds, punctuated with the ringing of bells, the angry shouts of guards as they escort their worthy charges through the press of people, voices raised in protest at some new law, and an assortment of other noises make High Hall loud. At night, however, it becomes deathly quiet.

                    <h4>Nine Bells</h4>
                    <blockquote>"Nine Bells, Nine Hells, all the same to me."</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Nine Bells district takes its name for the nine temples found in the heart of the district. Since these temples cater to the sick and the poor, this district draws the hungry, the diseased, and the destitute to its streets. Before the walls were raised here, Nine Bells was a place of great wealth-a community favored by those rich citizens who wanted to escape the clamor of the city. However, after it was annexed along with Blister and the Boneyard, the estates were abandoned and the folks fled to Stonehammer or Elftown to escape the flood of destitute people that washed into the place. Now, Nine Bells is the worst part of the city and is ever a source of embarrassment for the city's elite.

                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        With rotting estates, old vineyards now overrun by tents and wooden shacks, sagging rowhouses, and communities of tents, Nine Bells decays even while the rest of the city grows strong. The businesses, such as they are,
                        cater to darker interests, including dreaming halls, sinister taverns, fighting pits, and disease-ridden brothels. Huddled in one corner of this district are nine great temples, raised long ago, but faced, on all sides, by poverty, despair, and the worst sorts of people imaginable. Called the Divine Knot, a few of these temples have been abandoned, while the rest keep small staffs of dedicated servants who soldier on to fight the misery plaguing this district.

                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        As one might expect, Nine Bells' streets are muddy lanes and narrow alleys, all filthy and most worming through the press of decaying buildings. Closest to the temples, the muddy roads gain cobbles, typically clean and free of debris.

                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        Nine Bells is the bottom of the barrel, so to speak, and it welcomes anyone who has nowhere else to go. Humans, dwarves, tieflings, halflings, gnomes, and even a few half-orcs scratch out an existence in this wretched mire. Despair is strong here and it drives many
                        of its people to commit unspeakable acts to survive. Drugs, prostitution, and even slavery can all be found here.

                        A dead dog rotting in the streets, a swarm of rats cornering a gaunt gnome in a darkened alley, a hideous crone hobbling under the weight of her scavenged scraps, a gang of children armed with sharp knives and hungry eyes, and a robed priest swinging a smoking censer to chase away the spirits can all be found in Nine Bells.

                        A fecal stench hangs in the air, mixed with the equally nauseating odors of vomit, rot, and rubbish. People here are unclean and their odors mingle with that of the befouled air to create a symphony of noxious odors. Nearest to the temples, the air grows a bit more tolerable thanks to incense and the modicum of respect the people show the men and women of the cloth.

                        carcass, the splash of effluvia, and the whisper of a threat.

                    <p>
                        Stonehammer occupies the southern half of the inner city, and it wraps around High Hall up to the Dwarfroad. Like Elftown, Stonehammer is home to the wealthy citizens of Overlook, specifically the dwarves. Since this district is cleaner, safer, and more exclusive than other parts of the city, great deal of resentment exists toward the folks of Stonehammer from those of lower means and status.
                    </p>

                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        Stonehammer is the most dwarven of districts, and its buildings are grand, sweeping, and magnificent to behold. Towers that thrust up from lower levels rival those found in High Hall in terms of height and grandeur. Since space is at a premium, the dwarves here have built upward. The wealthiest citizens live in the aeries, while servants, low-born dwarves, and all those who support the sumptuous lifestyles of the
                        elite dwell in the 'Dark-the bowels of Stonehammer.

                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        The towers feature wide, sturdy bridges of stone, each fitted with high railings to prevent accidents and equipped with everburning torches for safety. In the 'Dark, the roads are tight and twisting, threading around the towers' bases, and plunged in nearly perpetual darkness.

                        <h5>People:</h5>
                        Stonehammer is exclusively a dwarven district and nondwarves are not permitted to live here. Other races often work in the 'Dark, but even they must keep their residences outside the district. Folk here are wealthy and powerful, and they represent the best the city has to offer.

                        None; the air is clean, although a breeze might push the fetid odors from the rest of the city, but such occasions are rare and brief. In the 'Dark, dust, sweat, and wood smoke fill the air, tinged with a faint chemical smell.

                    <p>
                        Tradetown is a melting pot of all races, cultures, and occupations. In many ways, Tradetown is a lot like the Blister, but it has been established for longer and it has a mix of fabulous wealth and appalling poverty. Tradetown, as one might expect, is a commercial and retail district, where merchants, tradesfolk, and prospectors come to do business. Most middle-tier business-inclined people have homes here and gather in coffee
                        houses, upscale bars, and bathhouses to do business. In stark contrast to the bustling commerce, Tradetown is also home to a powerful thieving guild named the Lost Ones. A clandestine organization, they have agreements with nearly all the major enterprises here, offering protection (or rather exemption) from thievery and the promise to leave their customers alone.

                    <p>
                        <h5>Buildings:</h5>
                        Tradetown is a hodgepodge of stone buildings (many of dwarven architecture), wooden structures, warehouses, shops, inns, taverns, and everything and anything a person might want in a city of this size.

                        <h5>Streets:</h5>
                        Tradetown is every bit as cramped as the Blister and in some ways more so for the vendors and hawkers crowding the streets. Moving merchandise into Tradetown is a chore and often requires porters rather than wagons to transport anything of size. The roads are cobbled, but alleys and side-streets might be muddy and covered in rubbish.

                        Tradetown is home to a dizzying number of people,
                        from elves and eladrin to lumbering half-orcs and goliaths. Humans and gnomes rub elbows in taverns, while dwarves of low character might engage in backroom deals with sinister tieflings.

Shady men and women walk the streets, eyes in constant motion as they search for new marks, while grifters and charlatans peddle cure-alls or use trickery to part their customers from their coin. Urchins run through the alleys, leading visitors through the safer parts of Tradetown, while disguised halflings lead other visitors to the nastier corners, where the travelers can find beatings and robberies instead of their destinations.

                        Not a true district, Shantytown clings to the back of the city like festering boil. Shantytown is a wretched maze of tents, shacks, and rotting wooden buildings, and it is home to the poorest and most desperate of people that have nowhere else to go. Most of Shantytown's people are refugees from other lands, victims of tragedy and circumstance, or exiles who keep a low profile so they can go about their wicked business without attracting attention. Thus, Shantytown's people are beggars, destitute farmers, maimed adventurers, undead, necromancers, cultists, and worse, all thrown together in one of the most
                        desperate spots in the region.

            <h3>Brindol Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Brindol has a smaller population than it
                did before the events of the original Red Hand of Doom. But the last
                decade has brought mild prosperity to the region,
                with only bandits (such as Sinruth and his ilk) disturbing
                the peace.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h5>Population:</h5>
                6,700; another 1,000 live within
                a five-mile radius of the town itself. The people of
                Brindol are mostly humans, half-elves, and dwarves.
                The town's population swells by several hundred
                whenever some connected halfling clans known as
                "the river people" are in town.

            <p>
                <h5>Government:</h5>
                A town has a council, two-thirds
                of whom are hereditary landlords and the remainder
                of whom are guildmasters from the city's
                important trade guilds. Lord Warden Harrik Orenna
                is the public face of the council and commander of
                the city militia.

            <p>
                <h5 class="fullpage">Defense:</h5>
                The city has 200 soldiers under arms
                at all times, with about one-quarter on duty at any
                given time. In times of crisis, the Lord Warden has
                access to another 200 well-equipped but poorly
                trained soldiers by calling up the militia.

                beautiful valley. Sayre holds a university and
                a large number of artisans, making it a popular site for
                those who deal in either information or fine art.

                <h5>Population:</h5>
                Approximately 12,000, including
                almost 1,500 students attending the University. Most
                inhabitants are human, elf, eladrin, or halfling. Some
                dwarves also live in Sayre, although they tend to keep
                to themselves.

            <div class="fullpage">
                <h5>Government:</h5>
                Sayre is governed by Lord Divian
                Torrance, a politically astute nobleman adept at playing
                different factions of the city against each other.
                Power resides with Lord Torrance, as well as the Artisan's
                Guild and the University's archdean.

            <div class="fullpage">
                <h5>Defense:</h5>
                The Guards of the March are a force of
                100 soldiers led by General Alvro Taramin that have
                little to do other than patrol the safer sections in and
                around the city. Most merchants, guilds, and noble
                families have their own mercenary guards that protect
                their property and work together when danger
                appears. In a time of crisis, General Taramin has the
                authority to call on any house with its own private
                guard to cede command of their troops directly to
                him. Fortunately, he has never had to do so, but if he
                were, he could call over 2,000 troops. With a cliff, a
                lake, and steep hills protecting three sides of Sayre, the
                Guards of the March spend much of their time outside
                the city patrolling the farming areas to the west.

                to the city's finest artists and artisans, and is the place to
                go if you're looking for jewelers or sculptors. Low Mountain
                is home to most of Sayre's dwarves, and hidden

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Sayre is built in a small, defensible valley. Steep hills
                to the north provide protection from overland armies
                and make excellent spots for small defensive guard
                posts. The Lake of Songs sits uphill to the northwest of
                the city. Dammed at its outflow to help control floods,
                this lake is used year-round for fishing and recreation;
                it is extraordinarily beautiful and the subject of many
                paintings and tapestries by local artists. The Singing
                River descends from the lake and splits briefly into
                three branches as it flows through Sayre. A tall cliff
                guards Sayre's eastern flank, dropping 200 feet to the
                valley below. The only direction an invading army
                could easily approach Sayre from is the west, across
                the farms and fields, and guard towers alert the town
                to any threat approaching from that direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before Sayre was built, the city of Auger stood on this
                site, built over 400 years ago as a refuge for exiled diviners.
                A diviner named Auglos and his apprentices were
                driven from the island of Nefelus after he prophesized
                a local noble's death and was blamed by the man's relatives.
                After fleeing the family's wrath, Auglos settled
                in this particularly beautiful and defensible valley to
                continue his research into divination and communication.
                More academics and sages slowly joined him, and a
                small city - Auger - grew up around his tower.
            </p>
            <!--
            <p>
                Auglos's skill as a craftsman began to bring him
                fame. At first he specialized in divinatory devices
                such as crystal balls. His masterpiece was a huge glass
                globe the color of the evening sky, a device that could
                transmit messages thousands of miles and even across
                planes if individually crafted receiving mirrors were
                first attuned to it. Auglos sold the communication
                mirrors for extremely high prices, typically to merchant
                consortiums or the rulers of more prosperous
                city states. His customers never knew that if he chose,
                he could hear and see everything that passed through
                one of his glass devices, and that he also sold much of
                the information he obtained through his eavesdropping,
                resulting in an even more profitable secondary
                business in the espionage trade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Auglos knew that his glass globe created psychic
                ripples in the Astral Sea when it was used, but he
                didn't consider it a problem; how likely was it that
                anyone would be bothered? He should have done
                more research. His master glass, the device attuned to
                all the others that allowed him to listen in on so many
                fascinating conversations, created ripples near the
                githyanki city of Tu'narath, and psychic debris from
                the glass's communication soon caught the githyanki's
                attention. The githyanki quickly determined that
                someone on the mortal realm was using the energy of
                the plane to fuel a communication device. Paranoid
                in the extreme, within three months, the Lich Queen
                Vlaakith herself named this device the Bitter Glass
                and decreed that the psychic pollution must be eliminated.
                Her knights quickly carried out her orders.
            </p>
            <p>
                The raid on Auger was terrible to behold. Githyanki
                dragonriders shattered the town's dam, flooding the
                streets with water and mud, then proceeded to pick
                off fleeing citizens one by one. By the end of the night,
                Auglos and his assistants were dead, and the Bitter
                Glass was shattered and buried under the broken
                tower that housed it. Auger's remains were looted and
                abandoned, and survivors from the raid left the area,
                never aware of the reason behind the attack.

            <h3>Rebuilding</h3>
            <p>
                Shepherds moved back onto the site within sixty years,
                but without a dam on the Singing River, the site of
                the former city had become a flood plain whenever it
                rained. Finally, dwarven engineers rebuilt the dam on
                the Lake of Songs, and Sayre was built where Auger
                once stood. The level of the land had risen after so
                many years of floods, and none of the old buildings
                were still visible above ground. All residents of the
                modern city know that there is an old city beneath the
                streets, and some families dug down to take advantage
                of a pre-made cellar by digging through the roofs of
                old buildings, but enough people caused cave-ins or
                unleashed monsters that it's now illegal to dig into the
                undercity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sayre is ruled by a wily half-elven politician
                named Lord Divian Torrance, and under his direction
                the city goes out of its way to attract the finest artists
                and craftsmen in the land. As a result, many wealthy
                families call Sayre home, and all of these have their
                own mercenary security forces to protect their
                houses and workshops. Not much of a public militia
                is needed, although a small force controlled by Torrance's
                good friend General Taramin remains active.
                The public militia is subsidized by a public ordinance
                crafted by the wily Lord Torrance. Each family above
                a certain income level must commit a number of
                troops from their own personal guard units to the
                city's defense. This makes the city's safety the concern
                of all the wealthiest families, although it requires a
                charismatic and skillful general to keep all the different
                house troops in line. Sayre boasts a small theater
                and a large university that attracts scholars from cities
                across this corner of the mortal realm. For such a
                small city, Sayre is a shining beacon of light. Lord Torrance
                fully intends to keep it that way.

            <h3>Sayre Districts</h3>
            <section id="Fisher District">
                <h4>The Fisher District</h4>
                <p>
                    Located at the northern tip of the city, this low-lying
                    area is prone to floods during the spring rains. Fishermen
                    and fishmongers who live here ply the lake for
                    their trade and live in raised huts. It's possible to buy
                    fish in the market district, but the freshest fish can
                    be bought by those brave enough to come north up
                    muddy streets and buy the catch coming off the boats.
                    There isn't much crime in the Fisher District; most
                    fishermen have large families, and they police their
                    own neighborhood with stout clubs and many friends.
                    Interestingly, this is the one neighborhood that isn't
                    defined by the breaks of the river. Fishermen live on
                    both outer shores and both inner ones, crossing the
                    rivers in small boats or over swaying rope bridges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ketch's Catch:</strong> This small fish stand has a reputation
                    for bringing in some of the largest, tastiest
                    fish in the lake. More importantly, the stall is run by
                    Gloriana Ketch. She makes a business of tracking city
                    gossip while her husband is off fishing, and she's a
                    good source for anyone who wants to know the latest
                    city rumors about the nobles or anyone of importance.

                <h4>Prospect Hill</h4>
                <p>
                    This residential neighborhood holds the majority of
                    the city's grand estates and mansions. Flanked by
                    rivers on either side, the low hill rises gradually over
                    the rest of Sayre. This neighborhood was the heart
                    of the ancient City of Seers. All the richest citizens
                    of Sayre live here. There is virtually no crime here,
                    and private mercenary units ensure that the neighborhood
                    stays safe. Unsavory types moving through
                    Prospect Hill should expect to be challenged several
                    times, especially after dark.

                <p>
                    <strong>The Pillar of Hope Reborn:</strong>
                    This ostentatious
                    memorial is a 60-foot-tall pillar with an eternal, magical
                    flame atop it. According to the plaque this marks
                    the spot of "Auglos the Wise's tower in Auger, first
                    founder of the city that became Sayre." It's not particularly
                    accurate, being located almost 200 feet from
                    Telicanthus's mansion and the actual site of the tower,
                    but it's a good meeting spot for young couples on
                    Prospect Hill who wish to go courting after dark. The
                    beggars of Sayre have a yearly competition, awarding
                    50 gp to anyone of their ilk who can surreptitiously
                    climb the pillar and extinguish the flame. Guardsmen
                    usually find crippled and dead beggars under
                    the pillar for weeks afterward.

                    <strong>Telicanthus's Mansion:</strong>
                    Marked by gate pillars
                    boasting lanterns made from exquisitely blown glass,
                    this mansion was bought by Telicanthus and renovated
                    after the former owner moved south. It's one of
                    the social epicenters of Prospect Hill, and servants
                    and guests enter and exit it during most daylight
                    hours (or later, if Telicanthus is hosting a party.) A
                    competent and wily butler (Telicanthus's <span class="hidden">sociopathic</span>
                    servant Pennel) monitors all guests and stops anyone
                    who doesn't belong. Telicanthus's guards are notably
                    polite as they escort interlopers off the property. <span class="hidden">
                    Unlike other parts of the city, none

                <h4>The Glassworks</h4>
                <p>
                    This neighborhood on the eastern edge of Prospect
                    Hill is home to the city's artists. Sayre attracts many
                    of the finest craftsmen to this area. The wide roads
                    are lined with shops and stores, and are roughly
                    grouped by type of business. Businesses selling expensive
                    goods, such as goldmakers and jewelers, typically
                    have their own security. There's an atmosphere of
                    camaraderie in the Glassworks, and in the event of
                    trouble, all locals pitch in to solve the problem. Many
                    artists and shop owners live in apartments located
                    over their stores.

                    <strong>The River Jewel:</strong>
                    This is one of the finest inns
                    in the entire city, with superb service and prices to
                    match. Rooms are large, secure, beautifully decorated,
                    and extremely comfortable. The staff offers
                    any amenity a guest might want, and will send out
                    for food or items not offered in-house, and the chefs
                    are renowned for truly delicious meals. Rooms here
                    cost 15 gp a night, an outrageous amount compared
                    to other inns in the city, but rooms seldom go empty.

                    is as knowledgeable a dwarven craftsman

                    <strong>The University of Sayre:</strong>
                    Founded by a priestess of Ioun who was appalled with
                    the lack of learning among most people she met, the
                    university is a bustling school of higher learning that
                    teaches everything from agriculture to esoteric magical
                    theory. Students tend to be young and from out of
                    town, as the university recruits the best and brightest
                    from many different areas. The university is often
                    viewed as an excellent finishing school for noble sons
                    and daughters, and it isn't uncommon for loyal servants
                    to be seen dragging their drunken masters back
                    home after a rowdy night in the Dregs.

                    <strong>The Tankard of Ink:</strong>
                    This is a popular tavern
                    for students who want to be in stumbling distance of
                    their rooms after drinking, and for those who don't
                    care for the Dregs. Many professors from the university
                    have adopted the tankard as their own, as well.
                    This is the place to come if you want a philosophical
                    debate instead of a fistfight.

                <h4>Low Mountain</h4>
                <p>
                    While most races have integrated nicely in Sayre,
                    the dwarven inhabitants tend to keep to themselves.
                    Low Mountain is a neighborhood of high stone walls
                    and twisting streets. Non-dwarves have trouble finding
                    places in Low Mountain, as none of the streets
                    are labeled, and none of the buildings are numbered
                    or named. As they say, "If you need to know where
                    you are in Low Mountain, you probably shouldn't be
                    there."
                    The area is safe, with squads formed exclusively
                    of dwarven guards patrolling the streets after
                    nightfall, but it's not particularly exciting to nondwarves.
                    That changes if you're a dwarf, or have the
                    trust of one. Wonderful restaurants, clever sages,
                    and master craftsmen hide within the featureless
                    buildings. Some dwarves will accept a bribe to guide
                    outsiders to the right place and introduce them to the
                    right contact.

                    This small shop contains
                    two dwarven brothers, Andor and Toris Scrollstone,
                    sages who specialize in maps and locations. Commonly
                    consulted by explorers into the Underdark and
                    merchants who have long journeys ahead of them,
                    the Scrollstone brothers are the people to consult if
                    one wishes to learn more about Sayre's undercity.
                    They have old maps showing what
                    buildings used to be where.

                    This is the heart of the city for everyone but the
                    wealthiest citizens. The streets are full of people
                    from all walks of life, and any non-exotic object (as
                    well as many exotic and rare ones) can be purchased
                    here. Whether you're looking for ink from a giant
                    octopus or the feather from an angel, you're likely to
                    be able to buy it - or something that the seller swears
                    is authentic - somewhere in the market. This area is
                    characterized by narrow streets, tiny shop stalls, yelling
                    shopkeeps, and a multitude of different bazaars.
                    Due to the university, the market contains a great
                    number of booksellers and scrollmakers. Debt-ridden
                    sages who have been forced to sell their library
                    crouch side by side with itinerant thieves peddling
                    stolen spellbooks.

                    throw her a few coins when they pass by. In return,
                    she is unfailingly friendly to anyone who doesn't treat

                <p>
                    The March looks almost like a military parade ground.
                    This area was once the preferred spot for Lord Limbic
                    the Scholar, a former ruler who had an obsession with
                    statuary and monuments. As a result, he spent a great
                    deal of the city's coffers on self-aggrandizing monuments.
                    More than two dozen great statues, triumphal
                    arches to non-existent battles, and other spectacular
                    monuments stand in this area. They're starting to
                    decay somewhat due to a lack of interest in keeping
                    them pristine, but they define this section of the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Dangle:</strong>
                    This was originally named "The
                    Triumphal Arch of Limbic the Gracious" until it was
                    turned into the city's location for public execution and
                    punishment. Murderers are hanged from the 30-foot-tall
                    arch and left to dangle for a few days. Public
                    stocks are also located here, for punishments of a less
                    severe nature. Public executions are rare in Sayre,
                    and the city hasn't seen one in months.

                <p>
                    <strong>The Guard Barracks:</strong>
                    Sayre doesn't require a
                    large standing army thanks to the proliferation of
                    private guards, but the one hundred full-time city
                    militia the city employs are stationed in this gray, austere
                    building that is also known for its statue of Lord
                    Limbic standing on the roof.

                    Most of the city's entertainment is located in this
                    rundown, old section of the city. Dancehalls, seedy
                    taverns, pawn shops, breweries, and comfort houses
                    all crowd its narrow alleys. The area isn't immediately
                    dangerous to visitors, as thugs paid by local businesses
                    roam the streets with the intent of keeping people
                    safe in the theory that "a live customer is a paying
                    customer." They've been known to look the other way

                    been stuffed by a taxidermist and magically animated;
                    it staggers around the tavern to greet visitors.
                    The Inn of the Ugly Dog has cheap ale, mostly clean
                    rooms, good prices, and an ever-changing array of
                    owners as the property is a common stake in the

                    These are the slums of Sayre, and the area where the
                    city's undesirables live. Beggars and unsavory visitors
                    gather here, along with anyone too poor to pay for
                    lodging elsewhere. Abandoned and crumbling warehouses
                    hold rotting goods or illegal and smuggled
                    property. The streets are narrow and twisting, made
                    slick by constant mist that rises from the waterfalls.
                    Dark and smoke-stained buildings house beggars
                    with wet coughs from the constant moisture. Rats
                    scuttling through glassless windows provide one of
                    the few free food sources for the locals. It isn't an
                    attractive place to live, and visitors who show weakness
                    are likely to be preyed upon by the locals.

                    using it as a temporary headquarters.

                    bridge in Sayre. Beggars congregate in this area each
                    morning before heading out across the city. The beggars,
                    strangely, won't speak to anyone while near Lowbridge.
                    They won't ask for money until they've gone to other parts
                    of town, as they're careful not to draw attention to the

	<h2>Haven of the Bitterglass</h2>
	<p>
        Back in Overlook, our heroes had several weeks to relax and aid in
        the reconstruction of Overlook. One day after this respite our heroes
        were interrupted by an exhausted, panting soldier from Overlook's city
        militia. The soldier, a human named Coggin, had been sprinting through
        the city along with nearly twenty other Overlook soldiers trying to find
        them. Between gasps for breath, the overwhelmed (and slightly star-struck)
        guard told them why he has been sent:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "My name's Coggin, sirs. I was sent to find you. The guard
        captain asked that you report immediately to the West
        Gate. One of our scouts to the south reported that there's
        some sort of a flying warship headed for the city. It's armed,
        and it isn't built by any race they recognized. After how
        you've helped the city so much, the captain would like you
        on hand in case there's trouble. Sirs."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Our heroes rushed through the streets to the West Gate, lead by Coggin and
        joined by a growing escort of soldiers as they ran. They were waved quickly
        through several checkpoints before reaching the walls. Before they gained a
        vantage point beyond the city they heard a loud scraping and creaking noise,
        like the sound of heavy wooden timbers being dragged roughly across the ground.
	</p>
	<img src="../places/The Sacrifice.png" class="left" />
	<p>
        When our heroes reached a point that overlooked the west
        and southwest of the city, they saw that a flying galleon
        <span class="future">named the Conqueror and belonging to the githyanki</span> had ignominiously crashed
        into the war-torn turf beyond the city. The mast had
        an improvised white flag hanging limply from it. The
        galleon had skidded to a halt on the ground, and the
        ship looked to have already been in a war. Patches of the
        vessel had been charred by intense <span class="future">red dragon</span> fire, with other
        sections badly damaged as if struck by large weapons.
	</p>
	<p>
        Two lone humanoid figures were visible on board, waiting
        by the rail. Citizens outside the city were fleeing from
        the wreck as quickly as possible, and our heroes
        could hear their screams easily from the wall. Every guard
        nearby had a crossbow trained on the passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The (clearly rattled) local guard captain - a
        female human named Captain Jerra Dauralis - asked
        our heroes to accompany her down to speak with the ship.
        It took only a few minutes to descend the steps and
        exit the city's gate.
    </p>
    <p>
        The warship leaned to one side, and it had clearly been in a
        fight. Its sails were ragged, and the stern of the ship was charred
        from intense fire. A humanoid with greenish skin and gray
        robes stood by the rail <span class="future">Tokk'it</span>, hands held open,
        waiting for our heroes to approach.
        Closer to the ship, the other passenger is visibly exhausted and anxious,
        but just as clearly recognizable as Melvin. Breaking into a broad grin he saluted
        his old companions:
    </p>
    <img src="../pcs/Melvin.png" class="right" />
    <img src="../npcs/Tokk'it.png" class="left" />
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "Greetings friends! I'm glad to see you. It's been a while since we've talked so I
            though I would drop in and say hello. This githzerai is my friend and traveling companion Tokk'it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In all seriousness though, I've come to beg your help.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know I disappeared on you back in
            Fortress Graystone, and for that I appologize. I was summoned to the aid of my missing master Marduk Goldbludgeon
            via the psychic network linked to that ancient githzerai stronghold. He attempted to use it
            to pull me through the Elemental Chaos to him at a similar githzerai fortress called Akma'ad where he and
            other members of our monastic order were under attack by their mortal enemy: the githyanki. However, a
            covert attack by the githyanki during my transit severed my connection to my master and left me stranded
            in the Elemental Chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
            There I met Tokk'it and after a long journey to together we returned to what passes for civilization on that
            plane. We alerted the other githzerai in their city of Zerthadlun to the attacks and the damage to their
            psychic network. With their help we managed to repair it long enough to send some reinforcements to Akma'ad,
            including the two of us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our reinforcements were insufficient however, as during our long travels githyanki reinforcements arrived to
            swell the ranks of the sieging army. I gather you've seen them here as well. The tide was quickly turning against
            my brethren so in a desperate gambit a squad of us snuck through the siege lines, slew this ship's captain and commandeered the
            vessel from the enemy to escape and seek aid from you here. We managed to disable another ship before we got away.
            We were chased and attacked by githyanki lancers riding red dragons but we were able to outpace them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Akma'ad is some 140 miles southwest of here, about a day's journey in this tub if we can fly her properly.
            I don't know the exact numbers of the enemy, but I saw three war galleons like this one here and at least three
            lancers, so I'd guess two or three hundred. There were nearly 100 trained monks at Akma'ad and several dozen non-combatants.
            We need to return with help before the githyanki breach our fortress and exterminate my brethren.
            Please, time is short and we must hurry."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Captain Dauralis, silent up to this point, suggested that the Council would not approve depleting the troops from
        Overlook in the wake of General Zithiruun's invasion. Instead our heroes used their contacts to recruit a small force
        of mercenaries to aid them while the city made the ship flight worthy again. In less than an hour our heroes were aboard
        with small rescue force as the newly christened "Holy Cow" took to the air.
	</p>
    <img src="../tactical/The Conqueror.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        Tokk'it led our heroes to the bridge - a relatively bare room, boasting a runic
        circle on the floor and a ship's wheel standing before
        it. Windows around the room allowed the captain to
        see forward and arrowslits allowed spellcasters to target
        attackers to port or starboard outside the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dead githyanki captain's body lay in a heap on
        the side of the room. The rear of the bridge featured a
        heavy tapestry giving glory to a tall githyanki knight
        standing triumphantly before a throne.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tokk'it stood in the ritual circle, taking the wheel and concentrating. As he did so disembodied moans
        and screams started to echo about the ship as the psychic echoes of possessed githyanki sailors manifested as translucent shimmers
        to man the rigging. Tokk'it explained that this was normal - if a typically despicable piece of githyanki magic. When some of our
        heroes began to confuse githyanki with githzerai Tokk'it was quick to elucidate them on the distinctions - at length.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "The githzerai and the githyanki were once one people in the ancient past, enslaved by the mind flayers. After countless
            generations of brutal oppression, our people developed some of the psionic powers of their masters until one day the hero Gith
            arose to lead us to freedom and break the illithid empire.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, once her people were free she went too far. She launched a crusade to exterminate every last one of the
            mind flayers, turning the former slaves into a conquering army rather than a free people. Thus the githyanki - 'the children of Gith'
            were born.
        </p>
        <p>
            A great mind, Zerthimon, spoke out against Gith replacing one tyranny with another, demanding she step down. She refused and a civil war
            followed that nearly destroyed us all. Ultimately Zerthimon defeated Gith in single combat, and in his wisdom showed her the way of peace
            and spared her life. He exiled her and her followers to the Astral Sea where they became little better than bloodthirsty pirates.
            Zerthimon claimed the Elemental Chaos for his people - my people - the githzerai: 'those who spurn Gith.'
        </p>
        <p>
            To confuse githzerai with githyanki is an insult. Do not make the mistake again."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Tokk'it went on to admit that he doesn't fit in well with other githzerai. He had been rebuked by his elders for a lack of emotional control
        and disordered thinking. He found some acceptance with the female Gallia while they were romantically involved, but she broke up with him
        several months ago, and he hoped that proving himself a hero with this rescue mission might lead to a reconciliation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Elsewhere onboard, Melvin explained how important this mission was:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "This githyanki attack could not have come at a worse time.
            Most of the githzerai at Akma'ad right now are visitors. The
            abbot is hosting a meeting of extremely important religious
            and political leaders. Kath'ik from the Monastery of Nine
            Stones, Most Exalted Odos from the House of Reprisal,
            Wellik the Elder from the Tower of Dancing Flame ... all
            leaders that the githzerai look up to. I think they are deciding
            who will lead them in the upcoming war, and how involved they
            will be in aiding our world."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Kitara headed belowdecks to search the ship. Picking the lock to the captain's cabin, she found documents identifying the vessel as the
        Conqueror and the deceased captain as one Captain Dav'ot. The ship's manifest listed a full contingent of 140 troops, one dragon and one
        lancer, and a gish assassin named Brann'ot. There were orders signed by a Captain Iquel ordering the Conqueror to accompany the Sacrifice
        and the Tyranny from Tu'narath to attack the githzerai stronghold of Akma'ad:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Dav'ot,
        <p>
            We expect the attack to go smoothly and quickly.
            Our informer is inside Akma'ad already, and has
            agreed to assist Brann'ot in the assassination of the
            foul githzerai leaders. Once you receive the signal
            from my flagship that the defenses are neutralized,
            land the Conqueror at a safe distance from the
            fortress and disembark all of your troops along with
            the Tyranny.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the grace of High Emperor Zetch'r'r, Lord of the
            Astral Sea,
        </p>
        <p>
            Captain Iquel</br>
            The Sacrifice"
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In the first officer's cabin Kitara found three small, hand-drawn portaits of githzerai
        <span class="future">Odos, Kath'ik, and Wellik - the githzerai leaders then meeting in Akma'ad</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Less than an hour after our heroes departed Overlook
        on the damaged galleon, it sailed through wispy clouds.
        Suddenly, Lechonero spotted movement ahead from his perch in
        the crow's nest. Two red shapes flew out of a
        cloud, changing direction and speeding up as they moved in
        our heroes' direction. Lechonero saw two red dragons, each with a rider
        strapped on its back, and called the crew to arms, manning the ballistae
        on deck.
    </p>
    <img src="../places/The Conqueror.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        The highly maneuverable dragons strafed the Holy Cow with their firey breath, allowing the lancers
        to make charging swipes at the defenders on deck and be away before they could fight back, but
        Lechonero's keen aim whittled the dragons down and kept them from lining up ideal strikes against
        the ship. Combined with an assault by the mercenaries manning the ballistae and coordinated by Barases,
        the dragons were slain, forcing the lancers to glide unnaturally through the air to land on the deck
        and engage our heroes in melee.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as our heroes dispatched the githyanki Lechonero called out from the crow's nest again.
        The red dragon closing on the ship was larger than the two
        they just fought. There was one scarred githyanki riding it. This veteran dragonknight proved more
        strategic then his compatriots - attacking Lechonero directly to disable our heroes' best ranged
        attacks and staying out of the firing arcs of the ballistae. Still, Lechonero proved the more resilient,
        forcing the dragonknight to the deck where the rest of our heroes dealt with him handily.
    </p>
    <img src="../places/Akma'ad.png" class="right" />
    <img src="../tactical/Akma'ad.png" class="left" /
    <p>
        Our heroes passed over fields and woods that gradually
        give way to a reddish rocky waste as they approached
        the githzerai fortress. They saw signs of the battle before
        they saw Akma'ad itself; fire and smoke rose from the site
        in a dark pillar. The Holy Cow crested a final mountain range and saw Akma'ad below.
        The fortress was utilitarian and stark, with
        red walls rising up over a dusty valley. An overhanging
        mountain cave amde it extremely defensible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Akma'ad was surrounded by githyanki troops and a vessel
        identical to their own approaching them, troops moving on its deck. From the lettering on the gunwale, Lechonero
        identified it as the Sacrifice. Melvin rushed to the pilot's cabin and took the helm from Tokk'it. The two ships
        jockeyed for position, the ballista shots from each going wide. Barases organized a boarding party among the
        mercenaries - readying grappling hooks to bind the ships on their next pass. Once again they failed to ram
        one another upon their bow spikes, but Barases' grappling team caught the gunwales of the Sacrifice from a higher
        angle. The mercenaries brought the ships side by side, the Holy Cow hull resting on the edge of the Sacrifice's deck
        and Barases, Kallista, Kitara, and Karrion jumped dow to board the enemy ship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Helpless against the grapples and as the boarding party cut through her troops, Captain Iquel made good on her ship's
        namesake and steered her into the Holy Cow's hull, scraping it's keel across her own deck, destroying her sails and
        scattering the melee to deadly effect. Bereft of it's rigging, the Sacrifice lost its flight magic and hung as a dead
        weight from the grapple lines - causing the tied ships to begin a death spiral toward Akma'ad below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lechonero attempted to join the melee by leaping from the Holy Cow's crow nest to the rigging, only to have it
        collapse under him and tumble gracelessly 40 feet to the deck of the Sacrifice below.
        When Captain Iquel emerged from the helm and laid about her with magic Kitara answered in kind - the two wizard swordswomen
        swashbuckling across the heavily listing deck as bits of rigging from both ships fell about them. In the end Kitara brought
        Iquel to her knees and battered her across the deck and with a final magically-enhanced kick booted her off the gunwale to plummet
        to the ground far below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unable to prevent their eventual crash, Barases evacuated everyone back to the Holy Cow and strategically cut the grapple lines
        to drop the Sacrifice onto a force of githyanki on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the way down, it was clear that two squat guard towers perched
        on top of the steep cliff containing Akma'ad. Chains were stretched between them,
        holding back what must have been hundreds of tons of rock and
        rubble. Several githyanki were guarding the towers.
        Melvin managed to steer the Holy Cow into a rough landing against the
        towers. Quickly disembarking our heroes overwhelmed the githyanki squad guarding the clifftop and released
        Akma'ad's landslide defense on the army below.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a tremendous, deafening roar, a cascade of rock - from
        pebbles the size of a pea to boulders the size of a mule -
        tumbled down onto the githyanki army massed outside the
        walls of Akma'ad. At first, all our heroes saw was a blinding cloud of
        dust, but as the wind cleared it from the field, they saw that
        hundreds of githyanki troops had been pulverized by the
        rock, and the rest were scattered or fleeing outright.
    </p>
    <p>
        Karrion teleported the party into the midst of the remaining githyanki hugging the walls
        of the fortress while Lechonero sniped dangling from the chains that formerly restrained the landslide.
        Taken by surprise, our heroes wiped out the stragglers and were taken into Akma'ad by its defenders who
        had been holding a breach in the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
        The githzerai had suffered serious loses since Melvin's last count. Only about 50 fighting githzerai
        still survived, including Tokkit's Gallia.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Odos.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        The surviving githzerai, many of them wounded, gathered
        around an old blind githzerai who seemed as aware of his
        surroundings as if he could still see. The monk spoke in a
        rough tone.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "We're alive. I don't know how they knew we
        were here, but the cost was high. Too high. Both Kath'ik
        and Wellik are dead, along with dozens of our brothers and
        sisters. We lost the abbot and most of the monastery. Our
        conference is finished. Now I must decide our path."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        With an almost undetectable grimace, the stoic
        githzerai turned his empty eye sockets toward the lines
        of dead and wounded.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Gather your belongings. In the
        morning we travel to Sayre. There is a conference there
        I am obligated to attend before we depart for home."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        He paused and turned his sightless gaze in our heroes' direction.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "You aren't githzerai, but you fought for us. Who are you?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Tokk'it introduced our heroes and explained their
        role in the battle. Most of the githzerai hailed them as heroes,
        and Odos (the blind githerzai) grudgingly thanked them,
        but he was exhausted and grieving for his slain friends and
        came across as dour, pessimistic, and suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
        In speaking with Odos, our heroes discover
        that he was concerned greatly about
        his people and their future. He worried that Sayre was only a
        temporary solution, and doesn't know if there's anyone he
        or the githzerai can trust other than themselves. Odos was a
        good and just leader, and his taciturn nature was a reflection
        of the hardships his race has endured, exacerbated by the
        recent attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        He reveals that the githyanki attacked without
        warning, and they sent strike teams to the personal
        chambers of all the githzerai leaders, as if they knew exactly
        who to attack and where they were staying. He was convinced
        someone fed them information on the layout of Akma'ad,
        as well as the names of the leaders present. Odos himself was spared
        only because he stepped outside for a walk and heard the
        team of assassins in his room on his way back. He surprised
        the squad of three and defeated them single-handedly.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the githyanki assassins
        in his room had a small device that could be held in her
        hand. She was speaking into this object when he surprised
        the assassins in his room. It was green and looked reflective.
        Festivus inspected the shard of green glass, identifying it as
        some type of magically one-way communication device, allowing the
        carrier to transmit a message through some unknown ritual.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apparently attacks of this sort had been
        happening to githzerai enclaves and monasteries all over
        the mortal realm. Most had fled to a refuge in Sayre, a
        nearby city. Odos wanted to take his people there after the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Odos and the other githzerai had planned this
        meeting at Akma'ad to discuss whether or not to accept an
        invitation in Sayre to meet with a newly formed coalition
        of leaders from other regions of the world concerned with
        the extent of the githyanki invasion. Each comes from a
        homeland ravaged by the githyanki, and they're all looking
        for aid and support from their regions. Odos was bitter that
        the "humans" (he has a tendency to call all non-githzerai
        and non-githyanki "humans") sound divided over political
        issues when there's so much at stake. He was against going
        to the meeting, but after the battle felt that going to Sayre was the only
        choice for his people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tokk'it sought out Gallia to introduce her to our heroes. In the process of
        seeking her out, Tokk'it spoke with other githzerai,
        many of whom remark how they believed she was
        dead because she was trapped on the upper roof and surrounded.
        When Tokk'it found her, he is overjoyed she is alive, but she
        acted coldly toward him and shrugged off
        any questions about the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Tokk'it introduced Gallia to Karrion, she was polite but formal and quickly
        excused herself. Tokk'it was upset and Karrion attempted to console him with
        platitudes before awkwardly excusing herself as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sayre was over twenty miles away across rough terrain,
        and the githzerai had wounded who had to be
        pulled along in small carts. Due to the slow pace, it
        took two days for the githzerai to reach Sayre with
        their patients. Under the ministrations of Festivus and Barases and
        any githzerai healers, the injured troops began to heal.
    </p>
    <p>
        One the first night of the journey, the githzerai camp was quiet.
        Even the wounded seemed to have found some peace in the wilderness.
        Suddenly the peace was shattered as a commotion at the edge of the camp turned into an a series of
        hit-and-run attacks. Kitara and Barases chased the assailants into the woods.
        Once they were out of sight a githyanki emerged straight out of the
        ground at Lechonero and Festivus' feet, a silvery longsword poised to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a lengthy pursuit Barases and Kitara abandoned the chase and turned to
        return to camp only to be ambushed by their prey - aided by a masked female
        githzerai. They defeated the ambush, but the masked githzerai disappeared into
        the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lechonero and Festivus were pinned down by the gish assassin Brann'ot - a vicious melee
        fighter who put the two ranged combatants at a severe disadvantage. Ultimately they
        managed to spread out and encircle him, between their arrows and spells limiting his
        movement until they could whittle him down.
    </p>
    <img src="../places/Sayre/Approach.jpg" class="left" data-slides="../places/Sayre/Approach.jpg,../places/Sayre/Outer farms.jpg" />
    <p>
        Licking their wounds the band continued on to the city of Sayre. After several days travel
        they descended from the mountains and found themselves on the fertile floodplain surrounding the city.
    </p>
    <p>
        They made a leisurely journey around the Lake of Songs - dammed at its outflow and used year-round for
        fishing and recreation; its beauty a work of art. They followed the Singing River as it descended from
        the lake past bucolic farmlands and for the first time in weeks began to feel themselves relax.
    </p>
    <img src="../maps/Sayre.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        During the journey Festivus regailed her companions with tales of her years studying
        the Arts at the famed University of Sayre. She had run away from her home in Sherrbyr,
        fleeing the repressive society of her youth. Seeking a more accepting culture
        she came to this flamboyant metropolis which valued beauty and knowledge over religion.
    </p>
    <p>
        They heard the distant sound of church bells long before they
        actually saw Sayre. It lay in the valley below them, nestled
        between three rivers. Sunlight reflected from the city's canals.
        Although it had roughly the same number of inhabitants as
        Overlook, Sayre was a very different city. It was said to be a city
        of artists, artisans, and scholars, and one can see why. The
        sunlight filtering through the hills gave a golden glow to the
        entire valley. From where they stood, they could see mansions and
        palaces rising up from islands between the rivers, university
        halls jutting upward, numerous monuments and large statues,
        and the smoke from smithies rising into the air. Mist from a
        huge waterfall swirled along the southern edge of the city.
    </p>
    <img src="../places/Sayre/Overview.jpg" class="left" data-slides="../places/Sayre/Overview.jpg,../places/Sayre/Entry bridge.jpg,../places/Sayre/Gatehouse.jpg" />
    <p>
        A guardhouse stood in front of the great bridge that
        lead over the river into the city. A throng of people bustled
        about - buskers, salesfolk, travelers, beggars, and guards.
        Even a few rich nobles could be seen, riding in open-top
        carriages in their finery.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Pennel.jpg" class="right" />
    <p>
        A servant approached our heroes, haltingly.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Excuse me, but by any chance are you the Heroes of Elsir Vale?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        When they confirmed their not-so-humble identities the man continued:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "My master will be so pleased! You're quite famous; he was
        just talking about you today at tea. Would you do me the
        honor of allowing me to introduce you?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Given permission, he looked even
        happier and lead them through the throng to a darkdoored
        wooden carriage with remarkable stained
        glass windows. The carriage was pulled by two horses.
        The servant knocked once and opened the door.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "My Lord Telicanthus, may I please introduce the famous Heroes of Elsir Vale."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        A tall, spindly man stepped out into the sunlight. Lord
        Telicanthus was a githyanki.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Telicanthus.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        Fresh from their near-deadly encounter with Brann'ot, Lechonero had a near-violent
        reaction to the newcomer, warning "Githyanki!"
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Of course I am! I'm not associated at all with those
        murderous fellows in the Astral Sea, though. No, I left
        that life years ago and I've never regretted it once. I'm a
        glassmaker now, and a loyal citizen of this fine city. We
        can't help how we're born, but we can choose how we live
        our lives. Something that everyone really ought to learn."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        He was quite unlike any githyanki that our heroes had
        seen before, however. Lord Telicanthus had a warm,
        quick smile and eyes that make it clear he was very
        interested in whomever was speaking. He wore very
        fashionable, expensive clothing and had no githyanki
        jewelry or weaponry whatsoever. His handshake was
        firm, his voice clear, and he had only the faintest
        trace of an accent when he addresses the group:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "It's such a pleasure to meet you. We've received some news
        of our friends to the north, but I never expected to meet the
        heroes in person! Some travelers have brought word of your
        many battles. It's very rare to meet living heroes, so this is
        quite a moment for me. Are you just arriving here in Sayre?"
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        "Well, allow me to provide you with some most humble
        shelter! The finest inn in the city is the River Jewel, right by
        the bridge in our Glassworks District. Pennel?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        he turned to his secretary, just exiting the carriage.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Run ahead to the Jewel and book... [counting the group] Rooms for
        each of them. Put it on my account there, meals included.
        Let them know that their guests are people of honor, and
        are to be treated as such. It's so rare to get people of the world here, artists aside...
        Would you do me the honor of coming to tea
        tomorrow? All the elite in the city, from the mayor on down,
        would doubtlessly be honored to meet you. You'll be the toast
        of the town. Tomorrow, at my estate - I'll have Pennel leave
        details for you in the morning, and I'll send a carriage."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        After Telicanthus' carriage departed, our heroes found that the guards
        had refused to let their Githzerai companions
        cross the bridge into the city. Over objections like
        <q>their kind isn't welcome here</q> and
        <q>all they do is steal and cause trouble</q>
        our heroes managed to negotiate their entry, staking their
        reputation on keeping an eye on the immigrants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Passing through the gates, our heroes escorted the Githzerai
        through the broad, paved streets of the
        University. They walked next to academic buildings
        and past marble statues of long-dead deans, topping
        the hill and heading down toward the central fork of
        the river. Following the east fork of the Singing River southward
        brought them into Riverdown. The quality of
        the buildings began to degrade quickly once they
        were away from the university, and an oily mildew
        covered the stone walls. Constant mist from the nearby
        waterfall filled the air there. The streets
        boasted less wealthy individuals running errands, packs
        of unsupervised children, stray dogs, and people of
        questionable repute.
    </p>
    <p>
        They arrived at the Plaza
        of Vision, an open area in Riverdown only accessible
        by winding through back alleys that branch off of
        tertiary streets. It was an isolated and dark plaza surrounded
        by abandoned and rotting warehouses. A
        corroding statue of a skyward-staring wizard stood
        in an empty fountain in the middle of the square, flanked by a couple loitering beggars.
        Odos lead the group directly to
        a red building alongside the plaza - Kark'din, the Low Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Odos was appalled that the githzerai weren't living
        somewhere better. Riverdown was extremely poor, particularly
        when compared to the university district they
        walked through earlier, and Odos felt that this area
        was beneath the dignity of the githzerai. He was fuming
        by the time they arrived, particularly when he sees that
        the building used by the githzerai was an old warehouse
        painted with flaking, peeling red paint. A githzerai at
        the door readily admits them to the sound of raised voices coming from deeper
        inside the building. The words were unintelligible at first, but it
        sounded like githzerai voices raised in anger.
    </p>
    <p>
        There were thirty-five githzerai inside the
        makeshift "Low Sanctuary," an open warehouse that
        had been divided into sleeping, meeting, and eating
        sections. The structure was rough and dilapidated,
        but clean and organized. Its well-lit interior was a nice
        counterpoint to the slums outside.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Aziff.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        The state of the githzerai community
        in Sayre could, at the time, best be described as fractious. The
        githzerai had splintered into two groups who believe
        they should proceed in very different ways. One of
        the leaders, Aziff, urged patience and caution. She
        was convinced that the locals' feelings were temporary.
        She had lived in Sayre for many years, and the recent
        change in public opinion about the city's githzerai
        citizens had distressed her a great deal (although she
        didn't reveal anything but a stoic demeanor openly).
        Aziff had the backing of the other local githzerai.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other leader, an atypically fiery githzerai
        named Gal'ott, was urging action. Young and angry,
        he wanted to take the fight to the streets, organizing
        what amounted to a githzerai gang. Gal'ott and several
        other githzerai are refugees from cities and monasteries
        from elsewhere in the world. Many had traveled
        several hundred miles to get to Sayre after seeing
        githyanki destroy their homes, and they were appalled
        that nothing was being done there to combat the threat.
        These githzerai wore red armbands and never travelled
        alone, only adding to the local residents’ fears of
        exactly what Gal’ott was asking his fellows to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        The githzerai fell silent upon the entry of our heroes,
        eying them suspiciously until Odos spoke on their behalf.
        The locals related that though they were not sure why,
        as they had done nothing to provoke the response,
        the people of the city had turned against them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Guards harassed them and limited their movements,
        beggars attacked them and spied on them, and any robbery
        or attack that occurred in the city was being blamed
        on the githzerai. Even more worrisome, four githzerai
        out on their own at night had been brutally slain by
        someone using knives. The other githzerai had been
        unable to locate the killer, and the city guard seemed
        disinterested in helping, claiming that other githzerai
        are committing the crimes as they <q>turn on one
        another like a pack of rabid dogs.</q> The racism and
        hatred was growing. They blamed the githyanki Telicanthus
        for this, although they had no solid proof and he
        publicly urged moderation against the githzerai.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Amyria.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        At that a cloaked and hooded figure emerged from a back room.
        With a dramatic sweep of the cowl she revealed herself to be
        Amyria. Upon seeing our heroes, Amyria was overjoyed. The deva was tired
        and worried, and seemed to be carrying a great burden
        on her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
        She had spent a great deal of time in the weeks
        since she parted with the adventurers traveling
        outside Elsir Vale, seeking out the extent of
        the githyanki invasion. In the process, she had
        established connections in most of the cities
        nearby. She had also learned that githyanki attacks
        have come at the worst times for the defenses of
        every region. Only Elsir Vale has been spared - at
        least thus far - thanks to our heroes actions in
        defeating General Zithiruun. She knew it was only
        a matter of time until the githyanki try again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amyria had an agent in the household of Lord
        Torrance of Sayre and was suspicious of his connection (as
        well as that of other prominent citizens) to Lord
        Telicanthus. The githyanki, whom she went out of
        her way to meet at a social event the week before,
        seems genuine, but a githyanki operating so openly
        just seemed wrong to Amyria. She wanted to believe that not all
        githyanki are evil ravagers intent on conquest, but
        she was suspicious nonetheless.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amyria learned that two leaders in other nearby
        cities were seeking out allies. She felt that forming
        a more concrete alliance between all the besieged communities,
        city-states, and regions would help them all, so she
        had been spending a great deal of time fostering
        this idea. She had been marginally successful in
        putting together the war council, which was to hold its first
        meeting in Sayre in the morning. But Amyria herself
        had little more than a voice in the proceedings. She
        had no home community and represented only herself
        and her god, Bahamut. She was being allowed in the
        proceedings because she organized the event and
        chose Sayre as the site of the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amyria chose for the council to meet in Sayre
        because, like Odos, who grunted and noded when
        she mentioned this, she suspected that the githyanki
        have some means of communication that surpasses
        any sort of magic that she was aware of. They seemed
        able to react almost instantaneously to threats
        that marshal to meet them, and they strike when
        their enemies are at their most vulnerable. Only
        regions such as Elsir Vale (on a state of perpetual
        heightened alert), are having luck defending against
        the attacks. She also told our heroes that she tried to
        get to the island nation of Nefelus, off the distant
        coast, but there's some sort of blockade preventing
        any ships from sailing there. The knowledge of
        magic possessed by the sages of Nefelus was said to be
        nearly unsurpassed, but the University of Sayre is a
        worthy rival. She hoped to convince the war council
        that they should ask the scholars of the university to
        turn all their efforts toward uncovering the nature
        of the githyanki's communication network.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, Amyria had one other reason for coming
        to Sayre. She had a dream recently that had the
        weight of significance behind it. She wouldn't use
        words like "prophetic," but when she recounted
        the dream, her eyes grew distant and her voice
        soft as she related what she saw:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        In my dream I was standing in the midst of raw elements.
        Waves crashed around me and fires flared, and I was
        looking down through clouds onto a dark blue night's sky.
        Stretching across the sky was a giant spider's web that was
        woven between planes. It was silver and sparkled with stars,
        and at the end of each web line was a githyanki. As each
        githyanki spoke, the web sparkled, and a fat spider in the
        middle listened to everything that anyone said. The spider
        was beautiful, but you could tell it was evil, just like the
        people talking through it. It scuttled around, fixing frayed
        lines and tossing out new lines to new people. Most were
        githyanki, but some were not. One of the lines went to a
        githzerai.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        I looked harder at the spider, and I knew it was here in
        Sayre. I could see the city around it. So I came here. I think
        someone in Sayre is helping the githyanki, but we don't know
        for sure who it is, although we have our suspicions. And we
        don't have an easy answer about what to do about it.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Gal'ott responded:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Of course we do. We find your spider. We find him and kill
        him. We kill him and return to our homes.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Amyria replied:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        You think that's going to solve the problem, Gal'ott? We
        know of whom you speak. And he's politically connected
        to everyone who could help the githzerai! Kill him and get
        executed as murderers and traitors. I say we need to prove
        what he's up to, and then discredit him. It's the only way to
        help the githzerai.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        After some convincing, Gal'ott bowed his head and said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        I will comply with the majority. For one week. After that
        time, my people will take matters into their own hands.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The group begins to discuss strategy, Odos sitting in judgement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amyria was vehemently opposed to assassinating
        Telicanthus. Not only did she think it would be a death
        sentence for the martyrs who attempted it, she feared
        that the political backlash from all of his friends would
        put every githzerai in the city at risk. Worse, assuming
        it was he behind a possible githyanki communication
        web, she wasn't sure that killing him would stop it; he
        might be completely innocent. She was in favor of more
        investigation, and revealing Telicanthus as a fraud and
        traitor before dealing with him publicly. That way the
        githzerai couldn't possibly be blamed. She pointed
        out that Sayre hadn't been attacked by githyanki yet,
        and that may have been because Telicanthus was alive.
        She wanted the githzerai to join an alliance against the githyanki.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gal'ott iwas tired of being mistreated
        by the other races, whom he considered inferior to the
        githzerai. The very fact that they would allow a githyanki
        in their midst made them suspect. He was mistrustful, and
        thought that he should lead a small group of githzerai into
        Telicanthus's mansion to kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aziff had grown quite
        close to Amyria in the short time she had known her.
        She had lived in Sayre for a while and remembered a time
        when githzerai were not treated so poorly. While she didn't have much of a voice in the proceedings, she
        represented a large enough faction of local githzerai that
        Gal'ott had been forced to recognize her.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chend was an elderly githzerai who favored
        leaving the humans and the githyanki to their war.
        He thought they should leave the plane until the war
        was decided, then deal with the survivors. Odos knew
        Chend from long ago and valued the elder's views.
    </p>
    <p>
        After much debate our heroes succeeded in convincing Odos. He quieted the
        fractious githzerai and united them behind his will.
        He agreed to accompany our heroes to meet Amyria's
        alliance. Odos decided that Telicanthus should
        be investigated before taking more extreme measures.
        In the interim, Odos wanted to know how Telicanthus
        was connected to this web that Amyria foresaw.
        He led Festivus in the casting of the ritual
        Consult Mystic Sages to divine the information.
        The outcome was a brief verse:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Read the writing on the wall
        You are not far from a place where knowledge turns to greed
        Beneath the spice house lurks the profane
        And knowledge lies trapped behind the guardian
    </blockquote>
    <img src="../tactical/Ambush in the Plaza.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        On their way to a abandoned spice warehouse near Lowbridge to follow up on the clue,
        our heroes were ambushed by a group of beggars who turned out
        to be exceptionally well armed and armored under their rags.
        Using some evil divine artifacts, the well-trained gang proved a difficult challenge
        but were ultimately dispatched.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our heroes continued on to the warehouse in Lowbridge. It was abandoned a decade ago
        but still smelled faintly of exotic spices. The faded and
        chipped paint over the boarded main doors specified the "Ridolfi and Sons, Spice Merchants."
        Picking the lock and disabling the traps on the entrance, our heroes found the interior small,
        rotting, and empty.
    </p>
    <img src="../tactical/Covet House.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        A quick search uncovered a hidden trapdoor inscribed with the words <q>Give, and you
        will be given to</q> in Common. The trapdoor lead to a descending shaft punched through the roof of an
        ancient, buried building. This stone-walled building used to have interior floors as well, but they had
        rotted away. A tricky battle ensured with the guards (and the gelantinous cube filling the base of the shaft)
        as our heroes climbed down the rotting rafters.
    </p>
    <p>
        The shaft terminated in a former window leading to a tunnel formed by a buried city street. It's ends
        and the spaces between buildings had been clogged with mud and silt. This section of the street
        was excavated several generations ago, and has since
        served as a sleeping place and shelter to generations
        of beggars. Stopped up by silt and soil on either end,
        this 50-foot-long section of roadway was lined with
        ancient cobblestones and filled with sleeping pallets
        and the meager possessions of dozens of people.
        Across the street was the excavated
        entrance to what was once a grand temple of Ioun.
        The icon of Ioun above the doorway had been ripped
        off.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/Human Tiamat art.jpg" class="left" />
    <p>
        Opening the temple doors, the vestibule on the other side
        had an amateurish painting of a beautiful woman standing
        on a mountain of wealth, holding out her arms
        invitingly. Barases identified it as a painting of a human aspect of Tiamat, goddess of
        greed and envy.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/Tiamat art.jpg" class="right" />
    <p>
        The sound of religious worship droned through the closed inner doors, covered with the painted image of a five-headed
        dragon on it, crouched over a mound of treasure. The
        mound was worn down by the passage of many greedy
        hands.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Filth King.jpg" class="left" />
    <p>
        Bursting in on the cult, our heroes could tell the temple was
        once sacred to Ioun, but those days were long past. The pews
        were filled with beggars, all with their backs to their attackers, and a
        filthy and bedraggled priest across the room stood before
        an altar.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our heroes made short work of the assembly, but after a putting down the
        priest, he miraculously sat back up alive. Our heroes captured and questioned him.
        He named himself the Filth King and offered information in exchange for his life.
    </p>
    <p>
        He admitted a few
        weeks prior, he was approached by a
        stranger in a cloak. While he didn't see the man's
        face, the stranger offered to pay substantially if the
        beggars would harass the githzerai at every opportunity.
        He even offered the services of mercenaries in
        his employ - the Laughing Shadows - and a bounty on
        dead githzerai. The Filth King gladly accepted.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Treasure golem.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        Information given, our heroes let the Filth King flee and proceed to collect
        the pile of treasure by the altar. The coins began to slide and clink, moving by themselves as
        they surged upward. In seconds, a five-headed dragon made
        entirely out of treasure stood before them. Its hiss was the sound
        of coins rubbing together, and its heads snapped forward to attack.
    </p>
    <p>
        After overcoming the guardian, our heroes discovered a secret passage behind the altar.
        When they pried open the door, they saw a large stone room.
        It looked like it was once a library, but any books had long
        since rotted away. Instead, the walls were covered with
        thousands of lines of carved text, filling the space.
        Rising from the ground around the room was a group of
        pale, emaciated creatures. They immediately began to lurch
        toward the intruders. Their fingers were missing any flesh that might
        have once been there, and each fingerbone was sharpened into
        a point.
    </p>
    <p>
        After dispatching the undead librarians, our heroes search the walls for clues:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        A matrix of blown glass can be formed into a mathematically
        perfect sounding chamber, then used to amplify
        magical resonance. In theory, disconnected sheets of
        a similar substance can be attuned to the master. This
        would allow communication at unlimited distance. The
        question is: How can one handle the planar boundary?
        When I began this research in Nefelus,
        I never expected
        that this would be a concern…
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        A problem has developed. I need some method for
        shunting away the psychic residue cast off during communication.
        This seems to be quite toxic. I believe that
        I can redirect it into the Astral Sea, where it should do
        no harm to anyone…
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        The final Glass is more beautiful than I could have hoped.
        My apprentices have outdone themselves. A full 30 feet in
        diameter, it has anchored itself into the very nature of our
        plane, and hangs in space. Our ritual went flawlessly and
        it has taken on a life of its own; as thoughts travel from
        one external pane to another, the Glass shimmers like the
        night sky. It is quite beautiful. It seems to be invulnerable
        from the outside, as I intended, but the same protections
        have not transferred into the interior. This worries me.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        The interior of the Glass becomes a psychic maelstrom
        if the information flow is not redirected. I have succeeded
        in rerouting the rogue energies to the Astral Sea.
        So long as no one is bothered by them, I see no risk; and
        in such a plane, what are the chances that they will be
        discovered? So small as to be infinitesimal...
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        I am making only a few select panes linked to the glass,
        but it would be just as simple to make many. I expect
        that selling these to far-flung allies could make me a rich
        man indeed. I will need to consider it.

        Eventually our heroes discovered a note seemingly written
        directly to them authored centuries ago:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        You're watching me. I can see you, but you don't know
        that. You're listening to my words even though I'm long
        dead. No, not you! Idiot. You're just writing down my
        words because you were told to by the old man with a
        beard and a magic glass. I'm talking to the other people,
        the ones reading this on the wall. They know I'm dead.
        Oh yes, dead, mud in my mouth, river arisen! I sing of a
        ship that sails the air, that brings swords and fire. You've
        fought it, too, but it's worse for you. We're just going to
        die. They'll kill us all because of what the bearded man
        does, talking through the mirror. They'll just flood the
        room, and that will solve their problem until he finds it
        again. He's been looking for it a long time. You think he
        likes you but it's a lie. There was digging, you see, and
        cleaning, and many false leads. He'll use it to conquer you
        all, but no one will believe you. You'll have to prove him a
        liar. They can talk through it, you see. They've managed
        to do it, and the armies whisper through the blue darkness
        in a way that no one else can hear. You're dead if you
        don't stop it. Even now they are discussing you. <q>Distract
        them,</q> he is told, <q>this is too important to ruin.</q> But you
        can. Boy! Boy, I demand a goose! Pluck it and ruin it and
        save yourself if you find the right spot. Look for the old
        tower when no one expects you. It isn't where they think
        it is. Ask the dwarves if you like, the brothers who dream
        of maps. Because in the days to come SHE will spread
        herself, and none will be safe from HER reach, so you may
        wish to trust the speech of the Bladed Girl. Trust, trust her
        if no one else. If her people do not come together, they
        will certainly be ripped apart. Like my goose? I am so very
        hungry. I could use some tea. Boy!

        —verbatim account from the recorded visions of
        Graiden Brackenhaus, oracular guest of Seer Auglos of
        Auger, as scribed by Brother Pinnot from the Church
        of Ioun.
    </cite>
    <p>
        Emerging from the depths, our heroes head to the Low Mountain district
        and Deep Cartography in particular - a shop run by the dwarven brothers
        Andor and Toris Scrollstone. The brothers are experts in underground Sayre
        and relate the history of Auger - an ancient city run by the diviner Auglos,
        first founded on the site of Sayre and now buried underground by some unknown
        disaster. Though the plaque on Prospect Hill claims to be the location of
        Auglos' tower, the brother's maps reveal it should really be located beneath
        the spot where Telicanthus' mansion now stands.
    </p>
    <p>
        Information gathered, our heroes called it a night and retreated to The River Jewel
        to lick their wounds in the luxury gifted to them by Telicanthus.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next morning, just after dawn Amyria greeted our heroes at the inn, waking a few
        reluctant risers. Amyria suggested they all walk to the meeting of
        the potential alliance members in the March at a building on the University of Sayre's campus.
    </p>
    <p>
        En route, Amyria explained the situation:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        I've brought you with me as material experts on githyanki tactics and motivations, as well as defensive strategies to employ against our attackers. Your defeat of General Zithiruun has brought you renown among far-flung communities, especially those already affected by the invasion. It has made you honored guests of Sayre and other prospective members of the alliance. Hopefully it means they will listen to you.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        However, even with your reputation, going forward no government will take you seriously without the Coalition's backing. You'll need their support, but that will also open doors for you, and enable you to get places and see things you wouldn't have before. We need them to officially sanction you.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Without presenting a unified front, the githyanki will be able to continue picking off individual, strategically important cities as they see fit until there's no one left to properly resist them. We need to get the alliance members to transfer military units under their separate control to a central command. That way we can rally our combined might in defense against the more focused githyanki attacks.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Even with a common purpose, our efforts cannot be run exclusively by committee. The githyanki take their orders from the Lich Queen herself and can act with single-minded efficiency. We need the Coalition to elect a leader that can steer the council and veto individual members as their divisiveness begins to weaken us.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Unity under a leader is easy for those in command, but the Coalition must also become a symbol to rally the common troops and bring disparate peoples together. I suggest we find a name for the alliance, something all can follow.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Somehow the githyanki are a step ahead of us at every turn. When someone marshals a defense, they appear suddenly, perfectly placed to ambush the opposition. When resources are moved or someone goes into hiding they fall directly into enemy hands. Somehow the githyanki know our moves before we make them and can move immediately to take advantage. We need the support of the alliance to investigate their intelligence network or we will lose this war before we start to fight back. Though I would preach tolerance, his presence here feels too odd to be a coincidence and I find Odos' suspicion of Telicanthus catching. If he is involved, we need the support of the alliance – especially the lord of Sayre – to investigate him.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        And lastly, my dream haunts me still. Though I cannot in good conscience place its importance above the very real military threats the githyanki present, neither can I simply ignore it. Something about it makes me believe it to be important. I would have the alliance consider its implications, but I must leave it to them to decide whether to use common resources to investigate farther.
    </blockquote>
    <!-- <img src="../npcs/The Coalition.png" class="left" /> -->
    <p>
        They reached a beautiful old building once
        used for town meetings. The small lecture hall they entered entered looked like it
        had previously been used as a place to learn about the more
        esoteric elements of arcane magical theory. She had
        rented it for use as a central meeting place for her
        allies.
    </p>
    <p>
        After walking up a large marble staircase to the
        second floor, Amyria opened a set of double
        doors into a circular room dominated by a large
        semicircular table placed in the middle of the room, and most of
        the benches that normally occupied the space had been pushed to the
        walls. Already seated at the table were six members of the
        alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as Amyria began to look nervous at Odos's absence,
        the githzerai walked smoothly into the room - navigating the
        furnishings despite his blindness - and took a seat nearest
        the door. <q>Am I late?</q> he asks with an arched eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
        The room was filled with strangers
        of various races, all swept up in the heat of argument.
        They all looked up when Amyria entered, and she began to introduce
        everyone to our heroes and Odos.
    </p>
    <p>
        The female gnome <span class="future">(Brandowen Entromiel)</span> amidst the gathering recognized Lechonero and yelled:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        YOU BEAR-STEALING SON OF A BITCH! Where is he?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In response to which Lechnonero squeaked out:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Balugh loves me more! Stay back! Festivus likes to eat gnomes!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        prompty hid behind Festivus, made a nervous sound, jumped out the window and ran away.
        The gnome carefully schooled her expression before turning back to Barases and saying
        with a curtsy:
    </p>
    <p>
        The elderly elf <span class="future">(Caliandra of the Stagrunners)</span> watched the exchange and grumbled to the gnome <span class="future">(Brandowen Entromiel)</span>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        He never was particularly reliable. Disappearing at inopportune moments for months at a stretch. What Thrand ever saw in the boy was always a mystery to me – perhaps until just now. I do hope the lad hasn’t done anything to hurt relations between the Stagrunners and Astrazalian.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The gnome <span class="future">(Brandowen Entromiel)</span> carefully schooled her expression before turning back to the elf <span class="future">(Caliandra of the Stagrunners)</span> and saying:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        In business, Lechonero always represented you with dignity Elder. Though he was always brash and short-sighted. That kind of thinking has no place in this council. If this is who you bring with you it does make me question your commitment to these proceedings.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The elf <span class="future">(Caliandra of the Stagrunners)</span> took on a haughty expression and said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Merely a happy coincidence Brandowen. When you reach my age with a family of your own it will be hard to travel without tripping over a descendant or a cousin.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        After some more social awkwardness, Amyria recovered and proceeded to introduce the assembled
        dignitaries:
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Kalad.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        The first, our heroes had met before: Kalad. They had not seen him in some time
        but the heavily muscled dwarven paladin no longer looked quite as haunted as
        he did in the tunnels of Bordrin’s Watch.  He had been tasked with representing
        Overlook's interests in Amyria's alliance.
        Gruff but friendly, he proves a staunch ally of
        our heroes. And an unflinching supportor of Amyria. Not a practiced politician
        he came across as intractable and foolish to the other dignitaries.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Dusk Wardens, welcome and well-met! Even here Overlook can count on you to save the day. It warms my heart to see you all. Please, let me introduce you to the dignitaries present. Lords and ladies, may I present the Dusk Wardens.
    </blockquote>
    <img src="../npcs/Brandowen.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        The female gnome Brandowen Entromiel ruled over the mercantile settlement
        of Dornaithos, which trades both fine craftwork
        (including goods from the Feywild) and everyday
        items.
        A former lover of Lechonero's during his smuggling days,
        they suffered a hostile break up and Lechonero made off with her
        pet bear Balugh.
        She had dealings with the Elsir Consortium,
        a group of merchants from the Elsir Vale, and with
        traders in every major settlement across this corner of
        the mortal world. Gregarious and shrewd, Brandowen
        was well known for her business acumen and efficiency.
        It was rumored she was not afraid to resort to bribery if
        doing so would get a project or deal finished quickly.
        Brandowen wanted Dornaithos's fortunes to continue
        and thought running the alliance was a way to make
        herself more prominent and secure better deals for
        Dornaithos to provide war material.
        She curtsied to Barases and said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Lord Barases, it is an honor to meet you. Word from the Satyrides has been sparse since the fall of your father.
        Many feared you were lost with him. I’m glad to see that fear was unfounded.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Sir, are you well? You have the stink of Winter upon you…I understand the pain you must be feeling, but beware giving into darker temptations and straying from the Golden Throne. Titania's wrath is an endless terror, and with forces are moving against the Summer order I hear her temper is shorter than usual. [looks around worriedly] But I fear I've said too much already. Hurry home, it needs you.
    </blockquote>
    <img src="../npcs/Caliandra.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        Caliandra of the Stagrunners was an ancient elf
        who could trace her descendants back to elves who migrated
        from the Feywild almost eleven of her generations
        ago. She lead not only her own tribe, the Stagrunners (of which Lechonero is a part),
        but had also been named the voice of all the
        tribes that live in the wild reaches to the north and
        west of Elsir Vale. All told, she spoke for a group of
        twenty-five tribes.
        Fierce, wild, and haughty, she was stubborn and
        opinionated, and wasn't afraid to engage in a protracted
        argument about aspects of history that most
        people had long forgotten. She held influence
        with many gnome, elf, and eladrin leaders, much
        as a respected grandmother and advisor might.
        She leaned toward solutions that provided the
        most safety for the most people. She seemed to expect
        subservience, making her nearly intolerable
        to deal with.
        One of the naysayers of the group, Caliandra
        automatically assumed her age and experience made
        her the voice everyone else should listen to. She talked
        loudly, fiercely, and often, but she didn't mince
        words. She got to her point quickly. She favored action
        of some sort, but was like a ship in need of a pilot. If
        given a course that she could approve of - something
        that will let her lead her people to glorious battle
        against the invaders who have killed so many of her
        people - she would fight honorably and without hesitation.
        But she demanded respect, and was fond of rejecting
        someone else's idea out of hand, only to bring it back
        up minutes later as a concept all her own.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Lord Divian Torrance.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        Lord Divian Torrance was the ruler of Sayre,
        elected by a fellowship of scholars and merchants.
        He was a potent and skilled politician. His goal, first and
        foremost, was to see that his city came out ahead in
        the war. He wasn't willing to side with the githyanki
        invaders, but his goal was to lead the alliance so that
        his small city was given due representation. He knew
        that Sayre's leadership wouldn't have been consulted
        if not for the good fortune of hosting the first meeting
        and the absence of a representative from Nefelus,
        Amyria's first choice to host the meeting. But he planned
        to make the most of the opportunity and made it
        clear at every opportunity how relevant and important
        Sayre is to the coming conflicts. He actively opposed any plan
        that dealt with bringing Nefelus into the alliance,
        although he didn't openly say so.

    <img src="../npcs/Fariex.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        Fariex the Scalehammer was a tall, richly dressed man with a burnished dark complexion.
        He was a powerful merchant with interests
        in various cities. Fariex did not represent a city
        or other political body, but was invited because of his
        connections to many far-reaching settlements, townships,
        and ports, and the wealth and military might
        they represent.

        He was light-hearted by nature, and knew more jokes
        than most jesters. Far from a buffoon, however,
        he expected respect.

        He was slow to weigh the facts of a problem instead of quickly
        making up his mind.

        Generally quiet in the meetings, Fariex would occasionally interject a pointed question,
        especially if the topic of conversation touched on his
        area of expertise (namely, money and its movement
        through business affairs). He openly tried to
        catch others in duplicity or engage in some word play
        over a statement he perceived as absurd.
    </p>
    <img src="../npcs/Inogo Dravitch.png" class="right" />
    <p>
        Inogo Dravitch was a dragonborn priest of Erathis. Inogo hailed
        from the distant city of Sherrbyr (Festivus' home). This city lies far
        to the northeast, beyond Elsir Vale by at least three
        weeks' travel. Inogo was the current leader of this city of
        temples. A theocratic city state, Sherrbyr also boasted
        a massive college of divinity, where worshipers of
        nearly any deity could openly practice their faith.
        As a result of its varied populace, the city's leadership
        was formed of a council of priests of the most
        worshiped deities in the city. The council changed as
        the population changed. Some deities fell out of favor
        while others rose. But Erathis's worshipers had been
        a power in the city for years, and Inogo was the most
        recent in a long series of Erathis-worshiping council
        leaders known as Deacons.
        Sherrbyr was a city accustomed to nearly endless
        debate, thanks to efforts to accommodate every faith
        represented on the ruling council. As someone long
        schooled in this approach to government, Deacon
        Dravitch was well out of his league in a group that needs
        to make decisions quickly and decisively. He represented
        a powerful city, however, in terms of both its
        military and divine might. Sherrbyr could field a veritable
        army of healers, as well as a mounted corps of
        paladins. Inogo was mostly quiet in the meetings,
        speaking up only when a plan of action is proposed.
        Sherrbyr had yet to experience
        anything like the githzerai had at the hands
        of the invaders (in fact, Sherrbyr had been entirely
        spared, to this point). Upon seeing Festivus, Inogo said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        In Asterinian's name, the proscribed son returns! I would say your mother would be happy for news of you, but unlike you and your father – proper dragonborn aren't prone to exaggeration. Dare I hope that you have found your way back to Bahamut's wisdom?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        After a terse exchange with Festivus, Fariex interrupted Inogo began to preach to the assembly:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Enough Inogo, let the lady be. If either of you should be ashamed of your behavior it's you Deacon. Does Bahamut not teach tolerance and acceptance? A pleasure to meet you Lady. Though word has reached me of your music, I must admit I'm more of a fan of your wit and humor. Hopefully you can bring some levity to this otherwise rather dour committee.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Recovering himself, Inogo began to preach to the assembly:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        As a being of peace and civilization I refuse to commit any resources to a military solution before fully exploring other options. We should be negotiating with these githyanki to help them see reason.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        To which Odos responded:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        The githyanki are not to be trusted. They are a race of pirates and murderers – locusts devouring everything in their path. They will not be reasoned with.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        And Inogo quipped:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        And how should we value his word? I hear from the populace here in Sayre that these githzerai are little better than beggars and thieves.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Outraged, Odos bellowed:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        How dare you! You sniveling swamp wyrm!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Only to be interrupted by Divian Torrance:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Settle down gentlemen! We’re not helping anyone throwing insults about.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Their work cut out for them, our heroes proceeded over the next several days to network, convince, and cajole the dignitaries into a proper alliance.
        Ultimately the outcome was:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The group voted to name themselves the Gatekeepers at our heroes' suggestion.</li>
        <li>
            Lord Torrance
            immediately moved that only a sitting member of the
            alliance could be considered to lead, seconded by Brandowen.
            The motion was passed with a 6–1 vote, Kalad being
            the only dissenter as he grumbled loudly that the clear
            choice for leadership was Amyria. For her part, the deva
            showed no emotion other than pleasure that another of
            her goals had been met. Our heroes and Amyria were
            asked to leave the room, and after a heated, hour-long
            debate, the new leader of the Gatekeepers was announced as
            Lord Divian Torrance after some political horsetrading.
        </li>
        <li>
            The members of the Gatekeepers voted 5–2 in favor of transferring control of their military units to a central command.
            The motion was led by Kalad and seconded by Fariex. Inogo and Lord Torrance were the only two who hold out against this prospect,
            but Inogo was willing to accept Kalad as general.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Gatekeepers voted unanimously to take Amyria's dream,
            and the threat it represented, seriously. Inogo and Odos
            found common ground here, and unearthed a grudging
            respect for one another. The Gatekeepers agreed to let Amyria
            lead the way on this issue, giving her the ability to coordinate
            efforts to root out the <q>spider</q> of Sayre.
            Amyria's sanctioning by the Gatekeepers gave
            our heroes the ability to act on her behalf, and she immediately
            engaged them to help her in these efforts. She tasks them to
            investigate Telicanthus.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <img src="../tactical/Telicanthus__Mansion.png" class="right" />
    <img src="../images/Telicanthus_tea_party.png" class="left" />
    <p>
        Our heroes accepted Telicanthus' invitation to the tea party at his mansion.

        He sent a carriage to pick them up at their inn in the early afternoon, after their meeting with the Gatekeepers.
        The carriage arrived at Telicanthus' mansion on Prospect Hill at exactly the proper time.
        Telicanthus himself came out to warmly greet his guests. He looked a bit surprised at the weapons strapped to
        our heroes' waists, even if they were in peace ties, but was too polite to mention it.
        He invited them into his home and ushered them into the tea room, where he introduced
        them to the other guests:
    </p>
    <p>
        Lord Divian Torrance (pretending never to have met our heroes before), his wife Lady Catherine Torrance,
        General Alvro Taramin - Commander of the city guard, Archdean Isabelle Grimaldi - Archdean of the
        Sayre University, and Baranor the Black - an elderly retired adventurer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Telicanthus' home was beautiful. It was tastefully
        decorated with the finest art that came out of Sayre's
        robust artistic community. Paintings of local nature
        and city scenes hung on the walls next to beautiful
        tapestries; his porcelain and dishware were exquisitely
        crafted, and his food the finest available. Superb
        stained glass filled many of his windows, most of which
        he modestly claimed that he crafted himself. Exceptionally
        talented musicians behind screens played light
        background music that invariably delighted the guests.
        Even the air smelled nice, scented by exotic perfumes
        that Telicanthus bought in the Glassworks. Everything
        about his residence denoted taste and class.

        While some of our heroes kept Sayre's elite busy with small talk, a select few snuck away to infiltrate his home
        and investigate for evidence of wrongdoing. With a bit of careful lockpicking and playing with magical glass shards and a large mirror,
        Kallista discovered a hidden passage in Telicanthus' office down to a network of underground caverns teeming with githyanki soldiers.
        Sneaking past the initial guards she discovered the base of Auglos' Tower buried beneath the mansion, and inside it a team of githaynki
        ritualists chanting inside a 30-foot-diameter hollow sphere of blue stained glass: the Bitter Glass.

        Kallista relayed her discoveries to her fellows and with this final damning evidence they confronted Telicanthus in front of his guests.
        Lord Divian Torrance insisted Telicanthus be arrested on the spot and the githyanki flew into a megalomanical rant, attempting to slay his guests
        with the assistance of his valet Pennel. After a brawl that raged throughout the halls of the mansion, our heroes finally subdued Telicanthus.

        After Telicanthus' arrest, our heroes fought their way to the base of Auglos' buried tower and approached the edge sphere.
        The door faded away when they touched it, revealing the sphere to be full of blue light. Four githyanki stood on a
        narrow glass bridge, chanting as they obviously performed a
        ritual; their voices echoing strangely in the space. Psychic
        energy coursed up and down the walls as noticed the intruders and their chanting halted for a second. As the githyanki were
        forced to cease their ritual, a babbling backlash of psychic energy attacked the minds of everyone nearby, causing an immediate
        and intense pain. Half the party fought the ritualists and while the others battled the Bitter Glass itself using their arcane knowledge.
        Ultimately our heroes won the day and smashed the Bitter Glass.

        In the wake of Telicanthus' arrest Torrance seized ownership of his
        mansion and everything in it for the
        city. He offered to house our heroes
        there for as long as they required lodging.
