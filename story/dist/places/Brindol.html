            <h3>Brindol Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Brindol has a smaller population than it
                did before the events of the original Red Hand of Doom. But the last
                decade has brought mild prosperity to the region,
                with only bandits (such as Sinruth and his ilk) disturbing
                the peace.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h5>Population:</h5>
                6,700; another 1,000 live within
                a five-mile radius of the town itself. The people of
                Brindol are mostly humans, half-elves, and dwarves.
                The town's population swells by several hundred
                whenever some connected halfling clans known as
                "the river people" are in town.
            </div>
            <p>
                <h5>Government:</h5>
                A town has a council, two-thirds
                of whom are hereditary landlords and the remainder
                of whom are guildmasters from the city's
                important trade guilds. Lord Warden Harrik Orenna
                is the public face of the council and commander of
                the city militia.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5 class="fullpage">Defense:</h5>
                The city has 200 soldiers under arms
                at all times, with about one-quarter on duty at any
                given time. In times of crisis, the Lord Warden has
                access to another 200 well-equipped but poorly
                trained soldiers by calling up the militia.
            </p>
