			<p>Melvin comes to, groggy and bruised with a pounding headache,
				but surprisingly not much the worse for wear [effectively an
				Extended Rest]. The first sensation he encounters are the burns of
				abrasions on his shoulder blades and along his back, followed by the
				pins and needles in his left calf leaving his left hoof completely
				numb. Next the cold prodding of uneven stone against his flesh
				brings him fully conscious and he opens his eyes, though his
				surroundings brighten only slightly. He is slumped awkwardly in the
				center of a grey stone cavern, lit dimly by the eerie glow emanating
				from foul stagnant pools of water at various locations around the
				space. As he peers into the depths of the nearest pool, the water
				stirs and a frog-like form with enormous teeth and bulbous eyes
				emerges dripping slime. The small creature appears new-born shedding
				a translucent, gelatinous shell as it advances hungrily on Melvin,
				joined by one of its litter mates from a higher level of the cavern.

			<p>[The black circle in the center is an enormous stalactite -
				effectively a column, and all thin edges of the map open into empty
				space]</p>
			<p>After dispatching four of the hatchlings, Melvin takes a brief
				rest to catch his breath. Looking around him he spots rows of
				shelves carved into the central stalactite, several bearing bottles
				and jars of unguents, salves, and potions. A quick perusal of the
				shelves provides several healing potions that Melvin slips into the
				many pockets of his robes. His heart rate back to normal, Melvin
				listens for other threats.</p>
			<p>
				Melvin detects no immediate sounds of life, though he can see
				distant lightning strikes in the void through the openings in the
				walls and hear the thunder roll in weakly. There does not appear to
				be natural daylight, or even sky or ground for that matter. He finds
				no response as he attempts to reach out to his sensei. He assumes
				such a connection is unlikely without a focus like the dais.</span>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>
				I will start wondering very quietly trying to find my way? Do I need
				my torch out? Do I know anything about this plane? Said in an uppity
				voice "I have always wanted to visit limbo in the wintertime, I hope
				they have a good polo team...
			</p>
			<p>I like down, So I will explore down first.</p>
			<p>My goals: Find my master, dont die, and give him a look of
				"hmmmmm" (the look that parents give a child when the did something
				they probably should not have, we all know that look)</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>Climbing down the tiered cavern, Melvin ventures gingerly out
				onto the open walkway, the brittle stone bridge giving way to the
				open, littered void of Limbo: islands of stone tumbling like
				storm-blown clouds in the distance, laced with plumes of fire,
				endless, criss-crossing waterfalls, and lances of lightning. The
				nearest island looks to be miles away.</p>
			<p>After passing through the windy chasm, the stone bridge leads
				to a passge into a mountainside, but peering over the edge of the
				bridge Melvin can see the edges of the mountain - including the
				bottom floating in the void. A dizzying vertigo strikes him as he
				realizes he's looking at self-contained land mass, more like a
				giant, floating boulder than a mountain.</p>
			<p>Shortly inside the cliff face the passage dead-ends, dim light
				seeping up from a small hole in the floor with a ladder leading
				down.</p>
			<p>Listening at the hole, Melvin hears the near sounds of someone
				shuffling across a floor in a smaller space, muttering in
				Primordial: "Toothless fluxes, think they can keep me down here
				tending the pits." The voice trails off with the sound of a door
				opening.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>"Hello down there, anybody home?"</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>The muttering and shuffling stops for a moment before an
				irritated retort issues from below: "Begone, the hatchings have
				already been provisioned and the young are resting if you haven't
				riled them. You have no need of me, leave me be."</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>I am but a lonely traveler, lost and could use some help. I
				don't know how i got here. Could you please help me?</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>"[A slightly awkward pause, followed by the sound of closing
				doors] Come in traveler, I'll be right out."</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>hmmm, the cautious traveler heads down the ladder. Not knowing
				what he is getting himself into he is very cautious. he is greatful
				that he can make a hasty get away if he needs. But he must find out
				more about this place.</p>
			<p>I dont think that he is going to fake full out amnesia, but he
				will not tell too much if he does not have to. he goes down the
				hole.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>Melvin climbs down the ladder into a cramped corridor flanked
				by two closed doors. The corridor appears to have been etched into
				the stone by some acidic process, leaving odd runnels of stone along
				the walls.</p>
		</div>

			</a>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>Melvin will take it very careful since the person he is
				talking to is not visible. he will slide to c6 and go total
				defensive and say "hello?"</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>The hallway opens into a small chamber filled with a mid-size
				cot, a nightstand, and a small cage with something moving inside.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>do I recognize the animal? I will wait patiently for his
				return and not futz with anything. I will try to listen very hard to
				hear what is going on and be ready for his return. Is he armoring
				up? are there weapons being sharpened etc.? which way do the doors
				hinge?</p>

			</p>
			<p>i guess its good that i have a high perception.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>Melvin hears breathing and slight shuffling directly on the
				other side of the door behind him (C4)</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>Melvin will wait patiently and turn to the door (c4) He will
				remain where he is so he does not get trapped. He wants to be able
				to have a fast get away.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>The door swings open and a spiny, red, frog-like creature
				slightly larger than Melvin comes charging out with a bellow. Behind
				it is an oddly lit room lined with troughs of liquid heaped with egg
				sacs. A table with some tools lies in the center of the room.</p>
			<p>[Lost in Limbo - Slaad Incubator - Round 1] Melvin HP 62/70,
				surges 10/12, 1 action points. Positions: Melvin C6, Slaad Midwife
				C4. Melvin's turn [Even though you go first, the Slaad's lethal
				intent is clear]</p>
			<p>Slaad Midwife barks "Stupid cow, why didn't you just lie down
				and feed the spawn!" and raises its spines which ignite and launch
				toward you, filling the hall: Fiery Spines attack vs. Melvin</p>
			<p>...</p>
			<p>Slaad Midwife collapses in a rubbery heap in the doorway.
				[Combat ends]</p>
			<p>Melvin gains 250 XP.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>Closer inspection of the cage by the bed reveals a Slaad egg
				sac, similar to those you woke amidst earlier, though much smaller
				and oddly bruised. A series of medicines line the table's edge
				(effectively 1 Potion of Regeneration). Peering past the corpse of
				the Slaad, Melvin sees an oddly lit room lined with troughs of
				liquid heaped with tiny egg sacs. A table with some tools for
				manipulating the egg sacs (more gently than with the giant claws of
				the Slaad) lies in the center of the room. A series of tubes bore
				into the rock walls, gradually dripping water and ichors into the
				vats. A series of small flames, apparently burni A series of small
				flames, apparently burning without fuel or support, gently heat the
				vats from below. Puzzling over the apparent impossibility of the
				floating flames, one of them winks out.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>Inspect closer to the one that winked out. What is fueling the
				source? Could it be something else? I will say in Primordial "hmm
				very interesting, it appears to not have a fuel source." I will look
				closer at the one that winked out and then next closest one.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>
				<br/>1d20 + 6 
				<br/>17 + 6 = 23 
				<br/>The flames are little floating fireballs,
				they have no fuel because they just hover as free flames in mid-air.
				Intelligence check It strikes Melvin as similar to the free-floating
				rock formations and streams of water he was flying past when under
				the guidance of Mardak. They had no support and lightning flashed
				without cloud or target. As Melvin ponders this apparent
				impossibility, the next flame winks out, leaving nothing in its
				place.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>I Will take a closer look at one of the egg sacs that are no
				longer under a flame. Does it look close to hatching? Should I smash
				them? I don't want these to hatch and attack me from behind or just
				starve to death. If i can put the eggs in the cages and transport
				them upstairs so they can hatch and be out of the way. he will do
				one healing surge first though to bring him up to 62</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>There is no noticeable difference in the egg sacs over the
				flames or over the extinguished flames, though not much time has
				passed so it's unlikely the overall temperature of the water in the
				trough has changed much. These eggs are roughly the size of Easter
				chocolate eggs, so it's unlikely that they are close to hatching,
				and if they did it's doubtful they would pose a threat at that size.
				The egg sacs that hatched upstairs were roughly the size of beach
				balls. Though their surfaces were riddled with bubble-like pockets
				along their skins, giving them the appearance of smaller eggs
				layered on top of larger ones. Close examination of these eggs shows
				similar structures in miniature.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>Not much can be done here, I will close the door and go listen
				to the other door. I will try to lock the door. I will search the
				midwife for a key if there is a lock on the door and it is not an
				easy lock. This is all before listening to the other door.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>The door is locked and no sound issues from the other side,
				but a quick search of the Slaad Midwife and the nightstand by the
				bed produces a key that fits the lock.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>Well then, I will lock the incubator room and open the other door.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>The other door opens to reveal a store room with several
				tables containing larger versions of the cage near the bed, each
				containing even larger eggs (though still too small to hatch judging
				by the size of the tadpoles that attacked you upstairs). Cabinets
				under the table contain an odd collection of items. Some rope, a few
				odd pieces of clothing, a couple pouches and backpacks, some
				suspicious looking hard-pack food, and a handful of Sunrods (3). You
				also find 2 1,000 GP sapphires and 400 GP in coin. I take the gold,
				rope, clothing, and sun rods put the hard pack food in the pouch if
				they fit otherwise the backpack) And I head out the front door.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>
				If I can go in the same direction that I was going before I will do
				so. Otherwise I will turn back and go upwards at the hatchery.

				<br/>4 + 18 = 22
			</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>Melvin finds no other obvious means of egress from these
				rooms, and after collecting the supplies climbs back up the ladder,
				gingerly crosses the rock bridge in a sudden gale of wind, and
				climbs up the levels of the cavern where he awoke to exit by the
				upper tunnel.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>
				Please do it sneakily. stealth check 
				<br/>1d20 + 13 
				<br/>6 + 13 = 19
			</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>After the first bend in the tunnel, even the ambient flashes
				from distant arcs of lightning are hidden and Melvin finds himself
				in utter darkness.</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: orange;">
			<p>
				The cow is in udder darkness? he he After knowing his old
				companions he will attack with five storms first. +10 vs reflex, if
				nothing happens then he will pull out his everburning torch if you
				did not assume that was out in the first place. 
				<br/>1d20 + 10 
				<br/>2 + 10 = 12 
				<br/>Well nothing happened so he will take out the
				everburning torch if you did not assume it was out previously.
				Darkness turn.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div style="background-color: white; color: blue;">
			<p>Melvin pulls the Everburning Torch out of his backpack and it
				flares to life, pushing back the darkness before spilling into a
				vast openness that greedily devours the light. Suddenly the torch
				seems insufficient as it barely reveals the ground falling away at
				Melvin's feet. The bottom of a 20' pit is littered bones from a
				menagerie of different skeletons. Few resemble whole creatures and
				many bones show signs of being gnawed upon. A narrow, uneven band
				of some sort of calcified organic material mixed with longer bones
				stretches out into the void, branching, web-like to span the gap.
				At the flare of the torch, the sound of scratches on stone and
				guttural growls echo out of the darkness.
