  <p class="flavor"><b>Effect</b>: Once per turn as a minor action, you can place a Warlock’s Curse on the enemy nearest to you that you can see. A cursed enemy is more vulnerable to your attacks. If you hit a cursed enemy with an attack, you deal extra damage. You decide whether to apply the extra damage after making the damage roll. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Warlock’s Curse remains in effect until the end of the encounter or until the cursed enemy drops to 0 hit points or fewer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can place a Warlock’s Curse on multiple targets over the course of an encounter; each curse requires the use of a minor action. You can’t place a Warlock’s Curse on a creature that is already affected by your or another character’s Warlock’s Curse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you advance in level, your extra damage increases.<br></p>
