        <p>
          You capture the writing from one source (a book, scroll, or tablet) and cause it to appear onto a special prepared paper, parchment, book, or some other similar item. This ritual copies up to 250 words of text, enough to fill one page with text. A copied illustration counts as a number of words proportional to the amount of the page the illustration requires.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ritual can be used to copy a ritual scroll, even if you have not mastered the ritual on the original scroll. Creating a ritual scroll in this manner takes twice as long as creating a ritual book but has the same cost (in addition to the component cost of this ritual).

The new version must be your level or lower, and the component cost equals the difference in gold piece value between the old version and the new.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also use this ritual to resize magic armor (for example, shrink a fire giant's magic armor to fit a halfling).

          You ward writings so others cannot read them. Use of this ritual protects one page (maximum 250 words). You make the page appear not to exist, causing anyone other than you to ignore it; the page's presence is blocked from a reader's mind. You can choose instead to obscure the page with false writings, which you produce before performing the ritual. Other readers see the false text rather than the real text.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you perform the ritual, make an Arcana check, with a +5 bonus. The result is the DC for a Perception check to notice the concealed writing (readers use passive Perception unless they are specifically looking for concealed text).

          You transfer the magical qualities (properties, powers, and enhancement bonus) of an enchanted item into another object. You must maintain physical contact with both items for the duration of the ritual. The receiving item must occupy the same magic item slot (head, waist, armor, and so on) and be the same type (wand, rod, weapon, and so on) as the original item. The enchantment to be moved must be valid for the receiving item, so that you cannot transfer ranged weapon properties to melee weapons, cloth-only armor properties to chainmail, and so on.<br /> You can transfer an enchantment to an item that already contains a lower-level enchantment, but the receiving item's previous magic is lost. For example, the enhancement bonus and power of a suit of +1 barkskin hide (5th level) could be placed into a suit of +1 curseforged scale (3rd level), but the scale armor's existing power is lost in doing so. You cannot transfer an enchantment to an item that already has a higher-level

          You conjure a Medium unseen servant of invisible force. It obeys your commands, moves at your speed, can lift up to 100 pounds, and performs basic functions and repetitive tasks, such as cleaning, making camp, and moving, holding, or carrying objects.<br />An unseen servant never tires. It cannot move more than 20 squares from your space. It does not occupy any space and cannot attack or be attacked. Each unseen servant you currently control doubles the component cost to create the next.<br />Focus: A ceramic hand. The person who holds this focus is empowered to command any unseen servants summoned with it. If the focus is broken or not in anyone's possession for a minute or longer, all unseen servants bound to it disappear.

          When you perform this ritual, choose a specific active and permanent portal you can clearly see. Analyze Portal causes the portal to erupt with faint lights that flicker and spin, letting you learn a great deal about its destination and function. Its most basic effect is to reveal the portal's destination. Although a portal usually displays what its destination looks like, this ritual reveals the destination's name and its general location in the world or the plane on which it is located.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you learn the origin and type of the last creature to use the portal, you also learn any keywords associated with that creature.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyze Portal can also reveal the identity of the creature that created the portal. If no creature created it, you learn of the event that created it.<br> <br>

          You lay an illusion over an area of natural terrain, no more than 20 squares by 20 squares in size, to make it look, sound, and smell as if it were a different type of natural terrain. Artificial structures, equipment, and creatures cannot be changed. A meadow might look like a hill, a pond could look like a meadow, and so on; but a road or a tower in the area remains the same.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature can discern the illusion if it succeeds on an Arcana check or a Perception check (DC 10 + your Arcana check modifier). This check is a minor action if the creature has not interacted with the illusion, but can be made as a free action the first time the creature interacts with the illusion. If you conceal an area of hindering terrain, a creature is still entitled to a saving throw if forced into that terrain.

          You sever the magical connections that bind one place to another by way of a portal. The completion of this ritual successfully shuts a currently active portal and seals it. No creature, object, or energy can pass through a sealed portal. The portal is not destroyed, though it becomes both invisible and intangible, meaning that it cannot be perceived or interacted with while sealed. If the portal would normally disappear after a certain amount of time, it does so.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the completion of this ritual, make an Arcana check. A sealed portal can be reopened with the linked portal, planar portal, or true portal rituals, but the creature performing the ritual to reopen the portal must make an Arcana check that equals or exceeds the results of the Arcana check you made when performing this ritual. You can remove the seal on a portal you have sealed by performing this ritual on it again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of a sealed portal can be
          detected with the Arcana skill. The level of the magical phenomenon (the seal, not the portal itself) is equal to your level at the time you performed this ritual.

            The ritual grants you a single piece of information. That information can take the form of a word, a name, a phrase, or even a brief story, depending on what exactly you're looking for. 
            You can learn the name of the usurper who ended the Katerran Dynasty a thousand years ago, the burial rites of the Crimson Wolf clan, or the weaknesses of the shadow assassins who have been dogging your steps.

            The ritual can't uncover information beyond the ken of the most learned sages. It's of no use if you're trying to find the magic word that unlocks the vampire's crypt, because only the vampire knows the word. Nor can the ritual tell you
            definitively where great stores of treasure are, but the mystic sages could tell you where a specific empress kept her treasury in ancient times or whether the treasure was looted when her empire fell.

The assistants all chant in a fey harmony while you perform the ritual. Anyone you want to assist you in this way can learn the proper harmony during an extended rest.

          You create a shortcut across the fabric of the world, linking your location with a permanent teleportation circle somewhere else on the same plane. With a step, you can move from one circle to the other. As part of performing the ritual, you must sketch out a 10-foot-diameter circle in various rare chalks and inks. This temporary teleportation circle must exactly match the permanent teleportation circle at your destination. It disappears at the end of the portal's duration.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the completion of this ritual, make an Arcana check. The result determines the duration that the portal remains open. <br /> <br />

        <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use a permanent teleportation circle as the origin point of this ritual, making minor temporary modifications as part of the ritual. Doing this reduces the cost to 50 gp of reagents and grants you a +5 bonus to your Arcana check.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the portal is open, any creature that enters the circle at the origin point instantly appears at the other location, along with anything the creature holds or carries. The creature can even finish the rest of its move. Any number of creatures of any size can use an open portal; the only limitation is the number that can reach the circle before it ends.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone standing in the vicinity of either end of the portal can see a haze-infused vision of the teleportation circle at the other end of the connection, as well as the environment 60 feet beyond it. Effectively, everything at the destination within this area of visibility is lightly obscured, and
        the area beyond is completely fogged out. (Naturally, portals that last longer give you a better opportunity to study the place you're going to before you step into the circle.) Environmental effects at one end of the connection don't affect the other end.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most major temples, important wizards' guilds, and large cities have permanent teleportation circles, each of which has a unique set of magic sigils etched or inlaid into the ground. The exact sequence of sigils matters, because you've got to match it if you want to open a portal leading there. The sigils aren't any more complex than remembering a string of letters and numbers. You can use Linked Portal to any permanent teleportation circle whose sequence of sigils you know. When you learn this ritual, your DM will tell you at least two such sequences. In your travels and research, you'll undoubtedly learn more.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ritual can take you anywhere in the world, but it can't
        take you to other planes. Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block a teleportation ritual. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components.

          You create the illusion of a single creature, of any size from Small to Large. It looks and smells like the creature in question. If the creature can speak or emit sounds, the illusion can do so as well, but on a limited basis (subject to the DM's judgment)Ñit's not possible, for instance, for the illusion to engage in an extended conversation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can give the illusion simple instructions, such as having it wander a set area, appear to chew on local plants, and the like. Your Arcana check determines the number of actions you can instruct the illusion to take.<br> <br>

        <br> <br>The illusion can perform these actions in a specific sequence, such as moving, taking a standard action, and then moving again, either in an endless loop or starting in response to a specific trigger, such as a door opening.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also match each action to a specific trigger. An illusion might move when a creature moves next to it or cower and scream when it is attacked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creatures that view or interact with the illusion are entitled to Insight checks to detect the fact that it is false. This check's DC equals your Arcana check result. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees the illusion and each time it interacts with it.
