        <em>Enlarge.</em> The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by 8. This growth increases its size by one category -- from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on STR checks & STR saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size.
